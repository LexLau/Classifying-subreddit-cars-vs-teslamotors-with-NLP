7,Did a DIY chrome delete this weekend. Quick write-up on what I learned and whether it was worth it (lots of photos).,"Hello! Per [my post](https://old.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/eh1ilz/doing_my_own_chrome_delete_after_getting_several/) yesterday, I did a DIY chrome delete, and I thought I'd share some pictures and takeaways from the experience. Here are all the pictures I took (with captions):

TLDR - [Before and after pic](https://imgur.com/UivEJbu)

[Album 1](https://imgur.com/a/KYlEn5b) - Door handles, emblems, and repeaters

[Album 2](https://imgur.com/a/DhCgBHl) - Window trim

**Why did I do it?** Not because I hate chrome, but I wanted a more two-tone look where the accents matched the Tesla rims. Especially with blacks and greys, I find that I just prefer fewer shades of color when they're close together. I also decided to do it myself because I was getting much higher quotes than I was expecting in the midwest, but I also wanted ALL the chrome deleted so I understood.

**What method did I use?** Plasti-dip, because it's cheap and, worst-case scenario, removable.

**What did it cost?** About $20 and roughly 12 hours of time, cumulatively.

**What did I learn?** A ton.
* First, the more closely you tape, the easier it's going to be later and the less you'll have to fix. Leave yourself an entire afternoon/evening, because you don't want to be rushed.
* A second person to help tape wouldn't be a bad move.
* I figured out a better knife technique when scoring along edges (lightly, don't worry), so if I did it again, I would be much better at it. The parts that came out good came out REALLY good, so I would be able to get that quality more consistently.

**Was it worth it?** Yes! It's not professional, and it's far from flawless, but it cost me $20 and will look great to the majority of people who will see it in passing. The good thing is I can always touch it up if I need to, and I'll do a better job in less time.

8,Please tell me how to discern from a used Long Range and Performance model,"I'm shopping online for a used Model 3 from private sellers, and there has been confusion. People say they have the Long Range but advertising the range at 310 and vice-versa. When I try to decode the VIN of a known Long Range and a known Performance, the 8th digit (""B"") is the same and indicates dual motor standard or performance. Someone surely knows an easy way to tell. Please let me know.

I figured that Tesla would make 2 different VIN indicators to separate either Long Range or Performance, as they mark the digit ""A"" for the base rear-wheel drive. I assume this means that the primary difference between the Long Range and Performance is simply software-based and nothing to do with the physical build, which also allows me to assume that you can upgrade your Long Range to Performance, but I don't know this to be true.",teslamotors,1577645573,TwoTinyTrees,22,1,True,2019-12-29
9,Model 3 battery capacity and rated range math,"I just completed a road trip and ran a few calcs on battery size and rated efficiency. It seems the battery is smaller than the 75 kwh I've seen listed (unofficially) online and lower consumption is required to meet rated range than the 240 wh/mi shown on Tesla's energy screen. Do these numbers match your experience?

LR battery size: 72.8 kwh

LR RWD rated efficiency: 224 wh/mi

My calcs:
---
LR RWD Aero wheels, 15000 miles

- 100% range --&gt; 317 miles

- 1-317/325 = 2.5% degradation

- 50% battery usage --&gt; 35.5 kwh used --&gt; 71 kwh post-degradation battery capacity

11,The Reality of Powering Your Home from the CyberTruck 240 Outlet,"TLDR: Powering your home from the CyberTruck without disconnecting the grid through a transfer switch (e.g. Powerwall gateway) or manual process will cause your truck to explode when grid power is restored as  it will almost always be out of sync with the grid.

Assuming there is enough amperage to power a home from the 240 outlet on the CyberTruck you will need to either have a manual or automated transfer switch installed at your home in order to switch safely back and forth between truck power and grid power.  

You can also do this manually by shutting off the main, connecting the truck and then doing the reverse when power is restored (I guess from seeing the neighbor‚Äôs power being restored assuming you have neighbors) Screw this up and you are likely to brick your truck at a minimum or create a nice fireball in your garage or driveway.

If Tesla does implement this feature the only officially supported way would likely be if a Tesla Powerwall gateway is installed and the truck would act as a supplement to any available Powerwalls.

Here is an article and video of a 27 ton generator connecting to the grid out of sync destroying the generator and jumping off its cement pad:

Potential Model Y buyer here. I am looking at the Dual Motor AWD version. I don‚Äôt think I want the FSD upgrade but I do like that I can buy it later if I want.

Is there a ‚Äúuseful‚Äù life of obsolescence for HW3? Meaning at some point it will be discontinued for support and update purposes?

I'm not sold on the styling yet, more work to do there, but I like the concept I came up with for the clamshell doors. I‚Äôd also love a pass-through but that would dictate the passenger overhead glass roof being removable. I haven‚Äôt found out if there are any plans for that yet.

If you come across a supercharger that someone left a note on saying it doesn‚Äôt work, take a peak at the connector to see if there‚Äôs a little black piece of plastic broken off in one side.

I play a lot of podcasts, and upon selection I have to wait for the data to actually start downloading before the light grey line moves forward indicating buffered data so I can skip over parts I've already listened to, meaning that if it's a 3 hour podcast and I just need to hear the last 30 minutes, I have to buffer and slowly skip through 2.5 hours of content for no good reason.

If I get impatient and try to fast forward too quickly, it will skip down to the next podcast and I have to start the process all over again.

Shouldn't it just let me press the middle of the bar to skip straight to 50%?  It would save bandwidth and let me get to my content faster.

Also, it would be nice if the buffered portion of the bar were the same blue that's used in showing your path on the navigation instead of a light grey that contrasts poorly with the already grey background.",teslamotors,1577694235,martin0641,13,1,True,2019-12-30

The response was a paraphrase from Elon: this truck is designed to be the means of transportation on Mars, if people don‚Äôt buy it here, screw it. 

I think people need to step back from Tesla and view how the Cybertruck is a component in a much grander technology roadmap that ends with Mars.

I think people should run CFD analysis based on an  environment with much thinner air. Does the stainless steel protect against micrometeorites? Will the ‚Äòclear metal‚Äô glass protect against solar radiation? Will there be surface area to provide datalink services from a Starlink constellation in Mars orbit?

I pulled out and accelerated during a straighter bit and then lifted off expecting some regen braking and just got acceleration.

What's a bit disturbing is that regen and now one pedal driving has trained me out of using the brake pedal except in an emergency, so I was left going into a tighter corner having not touched the brake pedal.

I think that's the most lateral G force my family have experienced and the car handled great, but it really wasn't a nice experience and has me not trusting Tesla's FSD tech when it comes to determining what speed is appropriate for a bend.

I'm sure there must be safer ways to deal with ACC (which is intended for on the highway) when it comes to tighter corners.  Certainly I've previously had Autopilot engaged and it's reduced and then increased speed as appropriate.

And, by a similar logic, if there is an empty cardboard box laying on the street (you know it's empty because you can either see inside or its light enough to be moved by the wind), would the car stop?

The main reason I did this was I had some questions on the displayed range of the the car and wanted to see more detailed info from the car.  I am also a bit of a data whore so I love seeing this kind of info.     Some info on my car.    I am In Ontario Canada and got my car May 31, 2018.   It is a Model 3 LR RWD.

[https://imgur.com/gallery/r8myKjn](https://imgur.com/gallery/r8myKjn) 

There is some overlap but you get to see the basic info.    My main concern was that my max charge in range seemed to be showing less then it should.    My last full charge was showing 460-ish kms.   This is compared to the 525 kms that is was supposedly changed to at one point.   When I got the car it would show right around 500 kms which is what the car was rated at when I got it.   Now I expected some degradation but not quite that much.    The data from the app seemed to confirm this.  If you look at the screen shots my nominal full pack number is 68.8 kWhs with 3.1 as the energy buffer.   In comparison to the Bjorn's info in the video above he is showing the nominal full pack as 73.5 kWhs with an energy buffer of 3.3 kWhs.    Now his car is newer then mine being an dual motor performance but it also has significant higher kms.  In the video above it is almost 40,000 kms compared to my 26,500.   He also supercharges far more as is DC charging total is 6051 kWhs verses mine at only 318 kWhs.    So my assumption  would be that a car that supercharges more like in Bjorn's case would have faster degradation but that doesn't seem to be the case.    My regen total is higher then his because he must do far more highway kms then me.    My regen total is 1759 kWhs verses 1111 for his.   

But just wondering if anyone else has info they would like to compare.    Just want to see where my numbers are at compared to others.",teslamotors,1577741471,zombienudist,35,1,True,2019-12-30

My wife and I are going to test drive a Model 3 on Saturday. I am looking to purchase the SR+ model.

Does anyone have any insight on if this is a good/bad time to buy? I know Tesla is not like any other manufacturers, just didn't know if they planned on doing any price adjustments in the near future that I should know about.

They gave me an option to purchase without AP, but with the software restrictions they embed, it's just not worth it to lose out on all the neat features with AP (Easter eggs, heated seats, etc.)

Putting cheap Chinese Basenor mudflaps have drastically reduced the dirt that would accumulate on the lower half of the side of the car (although I'm replacing them with American made Rally Armor flaps), I've come to notice my trunk and backside of the car become absolutely caked with filth.

Thinking about total cost of ownership over say 5 years, even with another update to the S I'm thinking it shouldn't hurt the already depreciated used Model S's too bad. So maybe $30k after 5 years as a worst case. 

A brand new Model 3 stealth performance can be had for $50k, so in theory as a used car will go below $30k in 5 years.

203,Autopilot Software - Resale/Transfer Debate,"Likely a repeat of bits and pieces of other comments and threads so starting a clean slate for hopefully an open debate. I am genuinely curious about others thoughts on this topic.

Please add/expand, correct and/or reshape any pieces I may have wrong or that you feel need better clarification. 

Essentially, there are a couple of camps regarding the FSD (or previously EAP, or the original separately purchased AP) software upgrade and whether it should be tied to the car or the original purchaser. 

There‚Äôs also a secondary debate on the ‚Äúfairness‚Äù when Tesla strips software features from cars they buy, then look to resell, only to recharge for the activation of the previously stripped software.

My stance, at every step the consumer gets to make the decision on what‚Äôs fair or not and ultimately the market will decide if Tesla has made a smart business decision with their offerings.

Take Debate #1: Software Upgrades Tied to the Car or the Person

Sure, it would be sweet if we could just transfer the software package to our next Tesla Model, or resell it ourselves on the open market but for right now, the software is essentially still in the beta stages, and not fully released with all promised features. For the sake of the companies survival (and our future capability of getting to own and enjoy these cars), this revenue stream is just too vital to the company‚Äôs bottom line, plus it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs free to develop, there needs to be a way for them to recoup the initial and ongoing R&amp;D expenses.

If you have a counter argument that keeps the company afloat, I am all ears.

Now Debate #2: Removing Software Packages on Used Cars only to Resell Them (Rinse and Repeat)

Brilliant on Tesla‚Äôs part. First they‚Äôre taking the risk of buying the used car in the first place (and the seller agreed to whatever price they offered). At this point Tesla can strip whatever they want from the car and the new potential buyer gets to decide if it‚Äôs a good value for what they‚Äôre asking compared to what they‚Äôre offering.

I don‚Äôt see where either debate is unfair. Yes, future competition will make pricing more affordable for buyers BUT first Tesla needed/needs to prove to the market this endeavor is actually profitable, because until recently and technically they‚Äôre still not a fully profitable company (holding lots of debt and not exactly a cash cow), they aren‚Äôt making money consistently.

They‚Äôre so close to proving the model is worthwhile, if they haven‚Äôt already. The competition will come in, which Musk openly planned for and encourages, and the market will decide if the above practices are tolerable.",teslamotors,1577759866,RyanBorck,51,1,True,2019-12-30

# Range Anxiety

I was a bit anxious when we left, I knew the car could easily handle 200+ miles / 320+ kms, but we still supercharged to 100% almost every night or mornings ""just to be safe"".

Real anxiety hit between Page, AZ to Zion, AZ. While the distance between these two locations is not that much for any Teslas (116 miles / 186 kms), the fact that we were staying in a hotel near Zion National Park that didn't have supercharger (closest one being St George, \~50 miles / 80 kms), that it was 28F / -2C, in a mountainous area with potential snow/ice on the way was stressful to say the least.

Thankfully when we arrived we found a destination charger that was available and were able to charge for a few hours while we did a small hike in the Park. But without that I was seriously considering skipping Zion entirely and driving directly to St George to supercharge.

They really should add a Supercharger around Kanab, UT imo, that would allow to recharge on the way to mountainous areas and have more options to explore, we really weren't able to do anything but go straight to Zion.

We also followed Tesla's recommendation to heat the car before leaving then turning off AC and only leaving seat warmers on. That worked well for the entire trip, I'm not sure how much mileage that saved us but it worked just fine!

# Supercharger network

We were probably a little over cautious, whenever we needed to charge we didn't do Tesla's recommended ""charge enough to reach next destination"" we almost always charged up to 90-95% during the day and 100% in the evening to prepare for the next day's travel.

I reckon that's actually a better strategy if you go on a long road trip, it allows to have sudden changes in your route to visit something that isn't necessarily on the way/planned.

Overall there wasn't any issues with locations of Superchargers, except for the one lacking around Kanab UT that would be really helpful.

However, there were several locations (Scottsdale, Sedona, Flagstaff) with multiple charging stations malfunctioning. Either the car would instantly stop charging and not provide any error message, or we would get the notification that the charging port was defective. Some poor guy we met unfortunately didn't notice that, and wasted 30 minutes when he got back to his car and find it was not charging.

The worst case being Flagstaff with 12 charging stations but only 7-8 of them working, and for some reason some worked for some cars but not others. We were lucky to always arrive before others, but I've had to swap up to 3 times before finding a working charger. Other drivers I met there reported the same issues.

We overdid it on the way back from Las Vegas to Irvine which was the single longest distance, but with a 3 yo in the back seat, it was needed to stop every 1h30 or so anyway so we just took that opportunity to charge a bit. Probably could have done it all with just 2 Supercharger stops (technically doable with a single one but I wouldn't wanna risk that!)

# Cold temperatures

We averaged 275 Wh/mile / 171 Wh/km which I find surprisingly good (my lifetime average is 263 Wh/mile). But the cold definitely ate some of our range, we would lose up to 10% a night in the really cold locations (Sedona, Flagstaff and Zion).

# Snow chains

Amazon was unable to deliver on time the snow chains that should have been much easier to install... (my fault I should have ordered them weeks ago). All I had were Laclede cable chains, which are a giant pain in the ass to put on but even more so on a RWD Model 3. The gap between the tire and fender is ridiculously small. I'm an average height man and I could not jam my arm between the gap to properly attach the read locks on those chains. I tried pressing so hard I've got two bruises on my left arm -\_-

Without the help of a good Samaritan in Flagstaff that saw me struggle for 10+ minutes I'd never would have been able to put them on properly and would have had to cancel one of our pre-paid visits (Lowell Observatory, awesome place!).

For context this is what Flagstaff [looked liked](https://imgur.com/RDrgM96.jpg) the morning after we arrived (my car is hidden behind that center tree on the 2nd row of cars). Definitely going to be getting some proper snow chains for our next trip to Mammoth!

# Trunk/Frunk

Really thankful for the frunk and the hole in the trunk. Without them we'd have had trouble carrying everything honestly. We were 4 on the trip (wife, mother in law, 3yo and myself), 2 medium size luggage and lots of bags for food/drinks/various stuff. I'm not sure how we would have made this trip in our Camry without my wife and MIL being really uncomfortable with extra bags at their feet.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, great trip, Navigate on AutoPilot drove probably 90% of the distance, with me doing the driving in cities and in snowing conditions (even then AP would work mostly fine just no NoAP). Several times my wife would stay in the hotel with my kid while I would go supercharge in the evening so we'd be ready the next day immediately, being able to watch The Witcher while charging was awesome :D

Currently, we have a Honda Odyssey that we use for hitting the beach every summer.  It's large enough to hold 7 people + luggage and has enough range to not have to stop too often/long.  However, the Honda is getting old and will soon be retired.  I was thinking that a model Y might be the suitable replacement.  It would be perfect if we could extend the range to something truly massive (500+ miles).

Which brings me to the question; could you give up acceleration/top speed for range?  Would it take hardware (ie. different motors, more motors)?  Could you do it just through software (ie. limit acceleration)?

284,What happens when someone bashes in your drivers side window.,"'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house not a creature was stirring, except three dick heads in a mid-nineties Honda Civic pulled up and bashed my drivers side window in.....

 So Christmas morning a group of guys bashed in my drivers side window at 4am (and two other cars around mine) looking for stuff to steal. Sentry was triggered and the alarm was very loud and it scared them off pretty quick. I didn't have anything in there to steal except my sunglasses in the arm rest but thanks to the alarm they didn't take anything. My phone was pinged and I got out to the car pretty quickly to see the aftermath. 

Sentry Mode recorded all the angles and I was able to give the cops the make and model of the car along with most of the license plate digits (they parked their car right in front of mine, the idiots. It was rainy and they were just a bit too far away for the plate to be completely clear). And I only got one or two decent frames of the guys face on the left repeater.

Also, the alarm is LOUD. My neighbors were pissed.

Turns out  the cops were able to track the car down in San Jose (I was in Burlingame) and it had been associated with other break ins, buuuuut it was stolen and had been abandoned. Even with the couple frames of the perps face, I was told there were no leads. Merry Christmas to me. 

After vacuuming up the glass and duct taping a couple kitchen trash bags over my baby's blackened left eye in a 5am broken Nyquil sleep stupor I went back to bed without a shred of faith in humanity. 

Until...Fast forward to the 27th. I was home for the holidays and live in Los Angeles so I had to figure out a way to fix this pretty quickly. I drove over to the Tesla Service Center in Burlingame, CA and they refer me to a nearby company that can help me (Precision in Burlingame). They were able to drive out to me and fix it up like new THE NEXT DAY! After all the stories I've read of getting windows replaced taking forever, it was a pretty nice surprise.  We were on the road back to LA that day.

289,Experience with Tesla Before Buying,"My wife and I were looking for new cars. A few months ago, I started reviewing stock for a Model S for myself and started looking at the Model Y for my wife.  I first tried to look at an X but ended up thinking that it had bad visibility out of the back, odd that it didn‚Äôt have a 360 degree camera, and super surprised that it was going to be well over $100k with FSD. 

I wanted to take advantage of the tax incentive after finding out that the showroom or slightly used demo Teslas had very low discounts. I realized this too late.  I thought I didn‚Äôt care about the tax incentive. 

I put a down payment for a Model Y and got that ordered a few weeks ago. At the same time I found a few decent Model S in stock. By the time I checked them out online and possibly wanted to look at them in the Tesla location, they were already sold.  I even called the advisor on the way over and he told me it was sold 10 min earlier and he told me to make sure to reserve it next time. Since then, no similar in stock models have been close. 

I took my wife today to the Tesla location for her to test drive a 3 (since it‚Äôs closest to a Y) and all showroom cars and test drive cars were ‚Äúsold‚Äù. We couldn‚Äôt even test drive one. They had tons of ‚Äúsold‚Äù cars in the lot so they couldn‚Äôt be used. 

I‚Äôm super frustrated. Two days ago the Tesla advisor had one possible car for me with performance non-all season tires and they wouldn‚Äôt swap them out for me. They asked me what they can do to help and have not helped. 

My only bet now is to order one and pick it up in a few weeks. I am a bit disappointed that there isn‚Äôt a better process. And I lose out on the tax incentive. 

I am also super worried about reselling them when the time comes. The Tesla locations have no used cars in stock. The advisor even told us to send them to Carvana which is crazy. He also said that if we trade them in, they just go to auction. 

I also realized that I see no Teslas on the CarMax app. I wonder why that is. 

I feel like Tesla needs to ramp up used cars. Many people would love a used Tesla because the price is a bit crazy otherwise.   These are all first world problems and it‚Äôs also crazy to me to see so many $110k cars are even listed and sold on the Tesla site. Did I miss something?  Are there tons of loaded people or people living above their means?

He rarely uses it and was talking about trading in into a dealer for a different car.  I have a suspicion that that is a poor way to go about it and was wondering if the community could help me in a few ways if possible.  


a.) Is there a well known place for people to list their Tesla cars specifically?  In checking (Canada) most of them are just listed on auto trader.    


b.) I see that Tesla has a used section on their website.  Is that about the same as going to a car dealer for a trade in?

Tesla already moved my delivery twice, then this morning cancelled my order entirely by text - removed the VIN from my account, no apology or explanation. I called my sales person who said the car wasn‚Äôt even here, and the only way I can take delivery today is to pay $2,700 for a black car with fancy rims. Feeling like I had no choice, I paid the extra $2,700 so I could figure out next steps during the 7 day warranty. 

After waiting for three hours at the delivery center, dude comes over and said we don‚Äôt have your financing papers. I showed him what I received from the Credit Union, and he said it wasn‚Äôt enough, that I could wait two more hours to go through Tesla financing, but they won‚Äôt finance the fees so I would have to cough up another $5,000. 

I finally got home around 7:30pm without a car and had to cancel my order.

Service mode is hidden behind a few menu clicks, and I often forget to do it on my way into work. Would be nice to do this from the app. 

Additionally, it would be even better to let us park them up for a bit when we‚Äôre driving, as when it‚Äôs very cold (I live in MN), the wipers will freeze up on any setting other than full on, high heat defrost.

For instance, in Germany, Austria and Switzerland we have Ionity Fast Charging that max out the Model 3 charging power. In summer, you get 240kW easy.
The problem we are facing in winter is that battery may need to be pre-heated more heavily and if preconditioning does not start on time, you get crappy lower speeds.
The workaround is to tell the car to drive to a nearby SuC then cancel the navigation once arrived to Ionity. This sucks. So either make the Nav software recognize other fast chargers or add a freaking button somewhere to tell it to precondition the battery! This has been a major complaint from many European YouTubers.

It will cost me nothing to keep my Model 3 and enjoy the implementation of full self-driving. And I wouldn't get full featured FSD any sooner if I traded my Model 3 for a new Tesla and paid full price for the FSD option again. 

I don't need a new car and this one doesn't look like it's ever going to wear out so having to pay again for FSD is making it easier to delay the purchase. It makes FSD on the next Tesla seem like an extravagance. But full self-driving seemed like a necessity when I bought this Model 3.",teslamotors,1577883530,NeedMoreGrits,75,1,True,2020-01-01

Was always curious what the general flow was like buying a car off the internet. Here it is for those whom are curious.

This was the process in September 2018. Procrastinated just a bit (not much... just like 15 months) getting the video up. Don't think much has changed with the process now other than much faster turnarounds.

If you reside further than 220 miles away from a Service Center, the car will be shipped direct via third party carrier. You could possibly also travel to a Service Center to pick it up and drive home. (depends on State). I asked to pick it up from Colorado since it would be my future home, but was told it had to be Kansas or shipped direct. My carrier gave me a 30 minute walkthrough of the vehicle, but this could vary. I've read some just drop off the car.

Some states do not allow a Tesla presence, in these states the sales tax, etc... will not be charged at the time of payment. Tesla will send you all the paperwork required to do so yourself when your temporary registration is about to expire.

It also maybe a good idea to start getting insurance worked out, but a VIN usually takes a few days to be assigned.

For states that require a front plate, a front plate bracket attached via adhesive is included with the car. I think its worth the extra fee in my case to pay for the single plate option.",teslamotors,1577889631,Venator-Fox,16,1,True,2020-01-01

I have an iPhone. 6m - 1y ago it all worked perfectly. Get in the car - music plays. Sometimes it starts the music app with random songs, or if recently playing a playlist or Pandora or whatever it will play that. 

It should be noted this is exactly how every other car works in my experience.  Tesla worked better because the car turns on and connects Bluetooth as you are opening the door so is (was) usually playing music by the time you sit down. 

Then something happened. I know a lot of people complained about this auto start (I will never understand why) so I feel like perhaps the current situation is an attempt to fix it. 

What happens now - I get in. Bluetooth connects but it doesn‚Äôt play. It says ‚Äúselect media from phone‚Äù. I do that. It plays that selection for like 1/4s then stops. Now I have to select play from the Tesla screen too! This is the super annoying part. I can‚Äôt just play music from my phone I have to select play from both - and it has to be phone then Tesla in that order or it doesn‚Äôt work. 

And then - to add insult to injury - for some unknown period of time the phone will auto-connect and play music in the car just like before. It‚Äôs like as connecting and playing music puts it into the old way or working as if to say ‚Äúyes I want to listen to music‚Äù - which is why I have a theory that this new behavior is some half-baked attempt to please both sides they probably pleases neither. 

And I say ‚Äúrandom‚Äù because sometimes you get out of the car for a minute and get back in and have to go through this whole horrible process again and sometimes you get out for hours get back in and it connects perfectly. There literally seems to be no pattern to when it works one way and when it works the other.

Tesla may have been on Autopilot in California crash which killed two

Authorities assign investigation team that specializes in Autopilot system incidents to inspect Tesla Model S that hit Honda Civic
Associated Press in Gardena, California

The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating a crash involving a speeding Tesla that killed two people in a Los Angeles suburb, the agency said on Tuesday.

Video appears to show Tesla driver asleep at the wheel

Spokesman Sean Rushton would not say whether the Tesla Model S was on Autopilot when it crashed on 29 December in Gardena. That system is designed to automatically change lanes and keep a safe distance from other vehicles.

The black Tesla had left a freeway and was moving at a high rate of speed when it ran a red light and slammed into a Honda Civic at an intersection, police said. A man and woman in the Civic died at the scene. A man and woman in the Tesla were hospitalized with non-life threatening injuries. No arrests were immediately made.

An NHTSA statement said the agency has assigned its special crash investigation team to inspect the car and the crash scene. That team has inspected 13 crashes involving Tesla vehicles the agency believed were operating on the Autopilot system.

Results were published in two of those cases, one of which involved Autopilot. Results are pending in the other 10 cases, the agency said in a statement.

Messages were left seeking comment from Tesla.

Another Tesla crash killed a woman Sunday in Indiana. State police said the driver, Derrick Monet, 25, of Prescott Valley, Arizona, was seriously injured after he rear-ended a fire truck parked along Interstate 70 in Putnam county. His wife, Jenna Monet, 23, was pronounced dead at a hospital.

Derrick Monet told investigators he regularly used his Tesla‚Äôs Autopilot mode, but didn‚Äôt recall whether he had it activated at the time of the accident, state police Sgt Matt Ames said.

Earlier this month, a Tesla struck a police cruiser and a disabled vehicle in Connecticut. Nobody was seriously hurt. The driver told state police he was using the Autopilot system and had looked around to check on his dog in the back seat.

Both Tesla and the NHTSA have advised that advanced driver assist systems such as Autopilot are not entirely autonomous but require human drivers to pay attention at all times. But several crashes ‚Äì some fatal ‚Äì have been blamed on driver inattention linked to overconfidence in such systems.

In one crash report, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) referred to it as ‚Äúautomation complacency‚Äù.

The NTSB has criticized Tesla‚Äôs Autopilot. In September, the agency said that in a 2018 crash in Culver City where a Tesla hit a fire truck, the design of the Autopilot system ‚Äúpermitted the driver to disengage from the driving task‚Äù. Nobody was hurt in that accident.

The NTSB determined in September 2017 that design limitations of the Tesla Model S Autopilot played a major role in a May 2016 fatal crash in Florida involving a vehicle operating under Autopilot. But it blamed the crash on an inattentive Tesla driver‚Äôs over reliance on technology and a truck driver who made a left turn in front of the car..",teslamotors,1577909568,shellacr,117,1,True,2020-01-01

As an example, the highway on my way to work is 10 miles long and has a speed limit of 55 and most cars go about 72.  About 8-10 times per direction (almost once per mile), cruise control will suddenly reset itself to various speeds as low as 25 mph, which isn't just annoying, but potentially dangerous.  The amount of distraction caused by having to reset my cruise control once every mile, the constant startling of my passengers, and the constant automatic brake checking of vehicles behind me has led me to abandon using cruise control altogether.  I've owned many cars in my life dating back to '80's vintage models and with prices ranging as low as ""free, if you can get it to run"", and never had a problem with cruise control in any of them.  It's disappointing to drive a $50,000 car without it, to say the least.  It's also a bit problematic, because unless I constantly stare at the speed display in such a peppy car, I find myself going 80 or 90 without even noticing.

At this point, it's a problem that seriously needs fixing and I seriously doubt Tesla is planning on making the TA part of TACC optional.  I'm not an expert in drive by wire systems, but I assume 

1. There is an encoder at the throttle pedal which broadcasts a PWM signal to the ECU.
2. There is some way of extracting speed from the CAN bus.
3. I could build a simple cruise control using a common PID solution programmed into arduino or even a common omega controller.

I've driven on AP nearly every day for 18 months, and I can count the number of AP nags I've gotten on maybe 3 or 4 hands. And I'm talking about the first level nag, with the ""Apply light turning force"" message. I've seen the blue glow maybe five times total.

I didn't realize until somewhat recently that the reason people get nags regularly, while I don't, is that they keep *both* hands on the wheel. This ends up causing the relative torque on the wheel to be nearly 0, because the weight of the left arm mostly balances out the weight of the right.

But if you keep just *one* hand on the wheel, AP's torque sensor will be constantly satisfied. The weight of your arm isn't enough to override AP's hold on the wheel, so you can hang your arm off it without the car thinking you're trying to take over from the auto-steer system.

I hold the wheel with my left hand, and either allow the weight of my arm to hang off the wheel, or lean my left elbow on the window sill and let the weight of my forearm hang off the wheel. Both of these work great to permanently silence AP's nag system.

If you prefer to keep both hands on the wheel at all times, though, I've had some success with holding the wheel at 11:00 and 4:00, rather than 10:00 and 2:00. This lets the weight of your right arm satisfy the torque sensor, because your left hand grip only partially counters it.",teslamotors,1577941812,coredumperror,89,1,True,2020-01-02

It begins to indicate when it is level with the start of the slip road, and then almost immediately pulls onto the sliproad.

I was taught, and rule 272 of the Highway Code states that you should ""signal left in good time"". I usually start to indicate at the 3 bar countdown marker.

I have tried indicating (while NoA is turned on) at the 3 bar countdown... but NoA gets a bit cross and tells me it can't change lane then cancels the indicator.

I would bug report this but my voice recognition has lost the ability to do a bug report ;)

492,The tax situation in The Netherlands explained (why over 29.969 Model 3s were sold in 2019),"In the past weeks a lot of news about Tesla sales in The Netherlands were reported, and every article pointed to the tax increase starting 1 January 2020. It's quite a complicated system, so as a Dutch citizen I thought I explain.

In The Netherlands it's fairly regular that your company provides a car via lease. However the Dutch tax authorities see this as a form of income, which is taxed. We just simplified our income tax brackets as of January 1st 2020, which makes it a little bit simpler luckily.

**Principle**

So let me introduce you to *Bijtelling*, an added income tax for lease vehicles provided by companies (not only cars, since January 1st you can also get company bicycles!). The Bijtelling is different for different kind of vehicles, for non-zero emissions (ICE) cars it's 22%, for bicycles 7%, and for EVs the following values are used:

|Bijtelling|2018|2019|2020|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|2026|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|For EVs|4%|4%|8%|12%|16%|16%|16%|17%|22%|
|EV discount cap|n/a|50.000|45.000|40.000|40.000|40.000|40.000|40.000|n.v.t.|

So what do you need to do with that Bijtelling? You need to multiply the purchase price times the percentage and add that to your income (which is taxed). So if you lease a ‚Ç¨40.000 ICE the treasury sees that as ‚Ç¨40.000 \* 22% = ‚Ç¨8800 extra income. A ‚Ç¨2000 bicycle results in ‚Ç¨140 extra income.

EVs have a discount to stimulate the transition. Up to 2018 this was for the full value and fixed add 4% (which made S and X very attractive), since 2019 a cap was introduced for the discount. So in 2019 the first ‚Ç¨50.000 of the car 4% bijtelling was added, the additional value the regular 22% was added. In 2020 8% for the first 45.000, etc.

**Examples**

Let's compare values for Alice and Bob, who earn 3 times and 1.5 times the modal income and see what difference an EV in 2019 and 2020 makes (modal income is ‚Ç¨ 35.500 for 2019).

As of January first we have just 2 tax brackets: over the first ‚Ç¨68.507 income you pay 37,35% tax, over anything more you pay 49,50%. So additional income (bijtelling) for Alice falls into the 49,5% bracket, for Bob it's still in the 37,35% bracket.

A Tesla SR+ costs ‚Ç¨49.000 in The Netherlands, a LR AWD ‚Ç¨59.000. So the Bijtelling would be:

|Bijtelling|2018|2019|2020|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|2026|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|SR+|‚Ç¨ 1,960|‚Ç¨ 1,960|‚Ç¨ 4,480|‚Ç¨ 6,780|‚Ç¨ 8,380|‚Ç¨ 8,380|‚Ç¨ 8,380|‚Ç¨ 8,780|‚Ç¨ 10,780|
|LR AWD|‚Ç¨ 2,360|‚Ç¨ 3,980|‚Ç¨ 6,680|‚Ç¨ 8,980|‚Ç¨ 10,580|‚Ç¨ 10,580|‚Ç¨ 10,580|‚Ç¨ 10,980|‚Ç¨ 12,980|

For Alice, this extra income falls in the higher 49,5% bracket, This would mean the following additional extra yearly taxes:

|Alice|2018|2019|2020|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|2026|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|SR+|‚Ç¨ 970|‚Ç¨ 970|‚Ç¨ 2,218|‚Ç¨ 3,356|‚Ç¨ 4,148|‚Ç¨ 4,148|‚Ç¨ 4,148|‚Ç¨ 4,346|‚Ç¨ 5,336|
|LR AWD|‚Ç¨ 1,168|‚Ç¨ 1,970|‚Ç¨ 3,307|‚Ç¨ 4,445|‚Ç¨ 5,237|‚Ç¨ 5,237|‚Ç¨ 5,237|‚Ç¨ 5,435|‚Ç¨ 6,425|

And for Bob:

|Bob|2018|2019|2020|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|2026|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|SR+|‚Ç¨ 732|‚Ç¨ 732|‚Ç¨ 1,673|‚Ç¨ 2,532|‚Ç¨ 3,130|‚Ç¨ 3,130|‚Ç¨ 3,130|‚Ç¨ 3,279|‚Ç¨ 4,026|
|LR AWD|‚Ç¨ 881|‚Ç¨ 1,487|‚Ç¨ 2,495|‚Ç¨ 3,354|‚Ç¨ 3,952|‚Ç¨ 3,952|‚Ç¨ 3,952|‚Ç¨ 4,101|‚Ç¨ 4,848|

The bijtelling percentage is fixed for 5 years, so if you buy it in 2019 you get the lower tax for the full lease contract (4 and 5 year leases are the major majority in The Netherlands). It can save you more than ‚Ç¨1000 a year for 5 years in tax discount!

I hope these explanations and examples shed some light on the high Tesla sales in The Netherlands, and why add the end of 2020 and 2021 we will see more of those end of year pushes. And remember this whole story is only for company cars, not privately purchased cars. Feel free to ask any questions!

499,New Installation: 2 NEMA 6-20 outlets vs. 1 14-50,"Hi all,

I am in the process of installing solar panels at my house.  In conjunction with this work, my contractor is upgrading my electrical panel from 100A to 200A, and running a 240V line to the outside of my house for EV charging.  I don't presently own an EV but I am ""aggressively"" considering the Model Y (or possibly a 3 if I don't like the Y) once it launches later this year.  A lot will depend on whether or not they are able to buy me out of my current lease or if I'm able to use some other type of service to walk away close to even or, ideally, even.  But, I digress...

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate many of your suggestions regarding having a whole house surge protector added to the new panel, and some of you also suggested running a second 240V line through the same conduit.  I will admit, I hadn't thought of that.  I truly don't know whether or not the Mrs. will want an EV - she drives the big family SUV right now that also doubles as our vacation car to fit our stuff, so this second outlet could be just a waste.

But, I do like the idea of a little redundancy in the event the first outlet or line fails down the road, since the car needs to be charged often.

&amp;#x200B;

# TLDR; In an effort to keep the costs down and actually ""look at"" what I'd typically need, I'm considering having 2 6-20 outlets installed instead of a single 14-50 or a combination thereof.

&amp;#x200B;

I would request that instead of 12-gauge wire that they would use 10 gauge for efficiency and a larger margin of safety since the car would be pulling 16A regularly (80% of 20A on the circuit)... 

I only drive 10 miles each way to work, and a total average daily amount is almost always under 30 miles.  Not factoring in heating during winter months, I'm conservatively estimating a 300 watt-hour mile, but I do expect it to be better.  That means that I'd be using 9 kW of power for the day, which means in about 2.5 hours of charging at 240V \* 16A (3.84 kW), I'd be full again at my set limit.  Assuming at some point down the road the Mrs. does want an EV also, her commute is even shorter.

Assuming the absolute worst case scenario of a 500 watt-hour mile in the winter months (November through March), and doubling the mileage driven per day (from 30 to 60) for whatever reason, that would equate to 30 kWh of energy used.  This would still top off my battery in just shy of 8 hours of charging.

The car will almost always have an opportunity to charge for 8 hours nightly regardless of the scenarios barring any type of emergency type of scenario. (I do shift work, so on occasion I will work an evening shift, home around 11, and then have to be at work the next day at 8 AM.  Since my commute is so short, I'd still have an opportunity to get \~8 hours of charging)

While the 14-50 would charge faster, it seems like an unnecessary cost at this point:  More expensive outlets, breakers, wire, conduit, even labor to an extent...)

I've read that it will take a little while for the battery to warm up for charging - around an hour using 120V/20A circuits - but then it will charge afterwards.  I'm expecting the 240V/20A to be even more efficient.  I am expecting around 1 to 1.5 kW of the 3.8kW available from the 240/20 to be used to keep the battery at temperature during the winter months.

I also have a lot of access to Supercharging around me.  In the event of ""trips"" I can very easily top off or at least get half-way before I get home to supplement.

I was wondering if anyone knew more about the alloy used in the Cybertruck. I'm assuming that some of those panels will be under a lot of stress (not being body on frame, and also residual stresses from the manufacturing process), and also exposed to road salt and the resultant brine for extended periods of time in some regions.

One problem with stress corrosion cracking (SCC) is that it can cause catastrophic failure without presenting much of a pitted/rusted appearance.

37,Update: Diminished Value claim for Model 3 accident,"This is a follow-up and conclusion to a few posts I've made since the summer. My Model 3 was hit/run in a parking lot. SentryMode caught the whole thing on video and eventually deciphered the license plate of the guy who hit/run run me - [post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/cfpbed/it_happened_to_me_too_parking_lot_hitrun_caught/) and [post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/cg3jil/update_it_happened_to_me_too_parking_lot_hitrun/). Once the insurance claims were filed and the other guy was officially listed as the at-fault driver, and the repairs were made and paid for (and reimbursed expenses to me), I pursued a Diminished Value claim. For this, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/cq8vle/to_all_model_3_owners_whove_been_in_an_accident/) asking for data about any redditors experiences in this area. There didn't seem to be much personal experience, but u/PaleInTexas suggested AutoLoss.com. .... so with that whole introduction out of the way, here's the updated.

I hired Auto Loss and at first worked with Monica. She was responsive and helpful. AutoLoss provided me with boilerplate documents in which my scenario's details were pasted in, and I was directed to submit them to the insurance adjuster. AutoLoss never visually inspected my car, but based on details and the repair invoice, they suggested that the DV was ~$4800 (P.S. 2018 Model 3 LR RWD, first prod; $2600 of body damage on rear door and quarter panel, no structure damage). When I submitted that number to State Farm, they wanted an 'independent' appraisal of their own, for which they arranged and paid. Based on that appraiser's report, SF offered me $1800.

Any time I received any communication from State Farm, I forwarded it to Auto Loss and either Monica or Jesse would respond. Not immediately but in a day or two. They asked me to take my car to CarMax for an appraisal to buy it. I told CarMax everything about the accident, but I didn't mention anything about the DV claim. They are probably wise to the process, and wouldn't appreciate knowing that I never had any intention of actually selling. But I needed a real offer to know how much value was lost in the car's worth. AutoLoss and State Farm's appraiser both agreed that my car (pre-accident) was worth somewhere around $47k-$48k. CarMax's offer to buy was $37k. Obviously, CarMax's offer has their desired profit margin built in, but this offer demonstrated that my car had lost much more than $1800 worth of value.

I counter-offered to StateFarm at $4500. Of course, the adjustor is a professional negotiator, trying to pay as little as possible. So the conversations included lots of reason why he can't/won't pay that. He also told me that State Farm was very familiar with AutoLoss and was often unrealistically high in their valuations in their experience. He also told me that some of the claims had gone all the way to court and the car owner was stood up by AL because they didn't show. After all these reasons, State Farm offered me $2300.

It was clear to me and the adjuster that the claim wasn't going to be settled for $2300 and it wasn't going to be settled for $4500. I don't know how often these DV claims actually go to court, but I was starting to feel confident because the $10k difference between what **their appraiser** said was the pre-accident value, and the real/valid offer to buy from CarMax, told me that the number was closer to my position to theirs.

I explained all of this to the adjuster. I told him that I imagine that he has a large case load, that his boss wouldn't like to see this claim go unsettled, and that he was spending a lot of valuable time with me that could all go away - to settle for the middle at $3300. I told him he has 48 hours to get back to me.

At the 49th hour after not hearing anything from him, I sent the adjuster an email telling him the price just went up to $4100. An hour later, I got a phone call offering me $3000 and I agreed.

So I'm posting all of this for two reasons. First, to put some data out there about Diminished Value data for others to benefit from if anyone ends up in a similar situation. Second, to try to shed some light on the whole process of dealing with insurance company for a DV claim.

42,Regarding the missing drive selector and indicator stalks in the Cybertruck,"The Cybertruck test drivers are pressing a button on the top right of the screen to park and car and drive it off again because there are no stalks behind the steering wheel, but is this a realistic expectation of the production Cybertruck?

For comparison, here is the Model 3 launch test drive video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SWVS56aZU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SWVS56aZU)

Looks like in the Model 3 the UI all the interior hardware is the same, so how will Cybertruck pull this off? The short-term conclusion is, no it cannot omit the stalks just yet, but I would like to know if there's a new way to do things.

P.S. the Model 3 UI is pretty close to the release one, so the Cybertruck one is pretty exciting if they bring most of it to release.",teslamotors,1575060094,swiftcal3158,18,1,True,2019-11-29

57,So I did my first test drive today,"Had a interview that got pushed back, so I happened to be right by the dealership. I figured what the hell at least do a test drive and see if I enjoy it as much as others do. My experience was great from a customer service standpoint, didn't feel rushed or even bothered for that matter, I told the guys right off the bat that I wasn't looking to buy for awhile since I still have 4 years of payments left on my Ford, they totally understood and even on Black Friday didn't feel rushed at all, so kudos to the staff at my dealership.

&amp;#x200B;

Now on to the test, the salesman took me out to a model 3, not sure which version I was in, but after a quick little basic tour, I was off on the road...by myself, never done a test drive where I was solo in the car, that was neat. The car itself was great, it really does change your perspective when you're actually in one vs seeing pictures or YouTube videos. Took me a little bit of playing with the settings to get to a comfortable driving mode, my biggest thing was the regenerative braking, never been in a car that brakes as soon as your foot is off the gas pedal, or a car that doesnt creep when it is in gear. I got on the highway and tested out the autopilot, which as advertised was a cool feature, felt a little bit of resistance from the steering wheel when I first engaged it, not sure if that is a normal thing. 

The seats exceeded my expectations, I've heard of how comfortable they are, but man the reviews do not do them justice, truly a comfortable ride, I could definitely see myself on a long road trip in one. My only thing was the 15 inch touchscreen took a few minutes to get used to, but with time I would know it like the  backhand, reminds me of my iPhone, which was probably the point of their design.

All in all it was a short but wonderful experience, I can certainly see myself driving in one, just got to stay the course with my current car payments, and then maybe with a little luck in a few years I'll be back to the dealership to get one.

I currently have a 3 on order, but I've considered cancelling and putting money down on a Y. More space would be nice, and the Y would be great for the dog (65lbs). On the other hand, I absolutely love the way the 3 drives, and think I would be pretty disappointed if the Y ends up being too much less enjoyable.

I currently own a BMW 335 and have had X3 35i loaners from the dealership. The X3 and the 335 share the same engine and (I believe) the same frame, but there is a huge difference in driving dynamics. The 335 is a legitimately fun car to drive (not as fun as a Tesla, but still), whereas the X3 feels pretty tight for a crossover/SUV, but is pretty far from fun.

I've had this same experience test-driving or owning other makes and models of cars in the past - the version of the car that sits slightly higher up (e.g. Subaru Outback vs Legacy) or has a larger body attached to the same platform and engine invariably feel far less engaging and fun to drive.

I realize this is a natural tradeoff and you just have to decide which end of the tradeoff is worth it. But I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts on just how big the driving dynamics difference will be in the Y vs. the 3? The published 0-60 times for the X vs the 3 are 0.3 seconds apart, while the difference between the 335 and the x3 35 are 0.4 seconds apart, which leads me to believe that the relative differences might be similar. I've also read that the Model X is a pretty different driving experience than the S, which might mean that the 3 vs the Y will be pretty different. 

Anyone have any speculation they'd like to share?",teslamotors,1575128286,Trent_A,16,1,True,2019-11-30

208,Cybertruck still uses stamping presses,"A big selling point of the Cybertruck presentation is that this vehicle doesn't require stamping of metal due to the shape and material chosen (triangular stainless steel) which will reduce overall weight, and cost. 

I just noticed, while looking at the [Cybertruck](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck) webpage, that it absolutely does use stamped metal in its manufacture. If you look at the 3rd picture on that link (shown below), you'll see that the internal part of the Unibody appears to be all stamped metal. Which suggests that it also isn't Stainless Steel, due to the incredible challenges of stamping SS. Which also suggests that this vehicle will still require some sort of corrosion protection, usually applied in the form of paint.

216,My first road trip experience with a Raven Model X,"So my household owns two Teslas. I daily drive my model 3 and absolutely love it. Even with it being the AWD non performance model, the acceleration is exhilarating. 

My mother daily drives the model X in our family and we live in the middle of Mississippi. One might think being in this state the infrastructure is nonexistent but surprising Tesla opened a service center (lite) literally 25 minutes away from me and it‚Äôs helped us feel more at ease since when we bought both of these cars we were under the impression we would be dealing with Tesla‚Äôs mobile service. 

Anyway, even with the few reservations my parents had, for the most part they have rather enjoyed the model X. Fast forward (or perhaps flashback?) to yesterday where we decided to take a trip down to New Orleans for some shopping extravaganza. (Black Friday amirite?) my mother knew that charging would be a thing as we went 200 miles down to New Orleans with our model X raven long range that has 325 miles. 

I let it charge to 100 percent and the trip there really wasn‚Äôt bad at all. We charged for 30 ish minutes in McComb and went down to New Orleans without a hitch. We had to drive around a little while we were there so we had to stop at Slidell on the way back. My mother being full of range anxiety (couldn‚Äôt really blame her) we had to stop back at mccomb as well just the sake of our sanity. This being our first time, getting home with 17 percent might have been a bit much. We figured we would shoot past the estimated state of charge on arrival due to going 80 the whole way but it didn‚Äôt seem like it. All in all I really wish the malls in New Orleans had superchargers. Seems they are building one there now and it would certainly make trips much easier. It seems Baton Rouge has plenty of chargers, super and even destination.

280,Cybertruck Illustrates Tesla's True Boldness: Where Could/Should They Go Next?,"The Cybertruck demonstrated to me without a doubt that electric vehicles are an opportunity to bring about great change to the auto industry. Going away from this gradual incrementalism, with the new business model of preordering, I think new niches of vehicles could be met.

One of the primary niches I haven't seen exploited is the off-road van. I think this niche is the most versatile niche imaginable. It gives you a big vehicle to haul things in, go camping in on easy weekend trips, go off-roading in for fun

And they can come in more sizes too. I.e. a SMALL off-road van doesn't exist in the consumer market, but a very high demand military vehicle which does the same thing exists:

https://www.carsbase.com/photo/steyr-daimler-puch/steyr-daimler-puch-pinzgauer-710-mk958-pic71364.jpg

The Pinzgauer is a famous vehicle among overlanders. It's one of my favorite vehicles ever and if no automaker meets my demand for one when I am in the right point in life to buy one, I will end up with one. I'd basically sell my soul for a Cyberpinzgauer.

The other van niche is that of the large camper van: 

https://gearpatrol.com/2019/09/11/this-4-wheel-drive-ford-camper-van-is-an-overlanding-beast/

Another niche could be an off-road car with that air-ride suspension. So, think Subaru Outback and Subaru WRX rolled into one vehicle with Tesla performance and styling. Smaller, easier to park, good for quick weekend warrior camping trips, road trips and also has an extremely good N√ºrburgring time thanks to its low center of mass and coefficient of drag.

298,Near-term regulatory approval of hands-off highway-only FSD and permitting higher speed limits for highway-autonomous vehicles,"Looking back at my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/dd4m6v/the_benefits_of_sleeping_in_a_full_self_driving/) about sleeping in a FSD Tesla, I realized that this dream could be much closer than I originally thought. While the Tesla fleet taxi service would require off-highway FSD, there would be a huge benefit to allowing hands-off FSD for highway driving only. And highway-only FSD is much easier to do. You could even argue that it's already safer than a human without Autopilot.

Tesla owners could handle the last mile of getting to and from the highway ramps and use highway FSD to travel hundreds of miles while sleeping. This is especially exciting because I think we're pretty close to highway FSD being considerably safer than human drivers. I know the red tape will be a big hurdle but what do you guys think of the below possibility:

* A regulation within the next couple years or even months allowing government-approved autopilot systems to go without human supervision exclusively on highways.

* This has the tremendous benefit of letting Tesla owners sleep on the way destinations, which effectively makes journies of hundreds of miles take zero time. It would work like this:

1. Since it has to start on a highway, you would have to drive to the nearest rest stop, then hop in the back, and hit go.

2. Catch some Zs while the Tesla drives to the rest stop immediately before your destination, auto-parks, and wakes you up to take over.

3. If any issues arise on the journey, the Tesla pulls over to the highway shoulder, puts on the hazard lights, and wakes the occupant up.

On top of this, it's also possible that a regulation could be passed to allow highway FSD cars to travel faster. I know I'm really reaching here but imagine being able to wake up 1000+ miles from where you live every morning.

If you are coming up on a red light, it's paradoxically better to slow down and try to time it so you reach the intersection at full speed or at least a decent speed. Not that Tesla's are slow to accelerate from a stop but this would save energy and just be an awesome feature. Also, you could accelerate less quickly and thus save energy if you knew the red light around the corner would be green when you got to it. I think probably this would be a FSD feature. I'm not sure how much of a difference it would really make but it would be an awesome selling point and stoplight timing data may be useful to Tesla in other ways like further improving FSD.",teslamotors,1575195591,Intro24,5,1,True,2019-12-01

319,Tesla on-board GaN (Gallium Nitride) charger,"Currently Tesla integrates 16.5 kW AC chargers in their vehicles. This year GaN chargers started to become commercially available for phones and laptops, mostly in the form of USB Type-C chargers. Gallium Nitride has as wider [band gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_gap) of 	3.4 eV, which is about 3 times as wide as the 1.12 eV that Silicon provides. This wider band gap enables higher electron mobility and can maintain this at a wider temperature range (see Varshni's empirical expression).

Very theoretical stuff, but it can result in higher efficiency power conversion in a way smaller package. This could make the on-board AC charger both more efficient and smaller, or increase it's power. It could also enable the AC-socket in the Cybertruck and fast USB ports inside the vehicle. Even regenerative breaking could potentially become more efficient (but I don't know if power conversion is needed there at all).

I hope to hear more about GaN tech inside Tesla on their Battery and Powertrain Investor Day early 2020. If you will be there, please ask questions about this exciting tech!

324,Here's why I pre-ordered a cyber truck -- tell me if I'm stupid or crazy...,"If this has been discussed, please downvoted and direct me to the thread.
 
Okay, so when I saw the cyber truck (and I had no idea it was even coming) I thought ""holy shit, that... thing... is... AWESOME."" Then I saw that it was $100 to get in line for one, refundable at any time until delivery... So I pre-ordered a tri-motor immediately, DESPITE the fact that I cannot afford one right now. Here's my logic:
 
- it costs me nothing other than the theoretical interest I could earn on that $100 during the wait
 
- I *might* be able to afford it by the time they build them, in which case I'll be glad to have the opportunity
 
- PRIMARILY my thesis is that public opinion will inevitably shift by the time these are produced, and a spot in line will be a HOT commodity. Now, I may not be able to sell my place in line, per se, but certainly the ability to take delivery of one will have it's own inherent monetary value one way or another, as they will likely not be produced in huge quantities. 
 
- alternatively to the last point, I think it's likely that if the cyber truck is built in the current configuration, it will, again, likely be relatively rare, and if not right away, eventually very very sought after. So, if I'm able to take delivery, I'll be taking delivery of one of the most unique and impressive automobiles ever created, which again seems like a very good investment. 
 
For those reasons, it felt like an absolute no-brainer even to me, someone in no position to pay for a $70,000 truck. Am I crazy?",teslamotors,1575213931,groggyMPLS,59,1,True,2019-12-01

340,After Cybertruck Tesla will origami self-driving pods,"Elon said [Tesla will not have any major vehicle announcements for a while](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198723473708699648). 

Why?

Because he's fairly certain by 2022 they'll have really-properly-actually-full self-driving. So starting 2022, it doesn't make sense launching any new cars designed for private ownership. Especially nothing aimed below the 3/Y, because for most budget-restricted people, [self-driving taxi pods offer much better value compared to private ownership](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWgrvNHjKkY).

And if you're making pods for fleets (either owned by, or purchased from, Tesla), you don't care too much about looks. You want the pods that are durable. You want to make them really cheaply (since you want to make a million of them for your fleet). You want their engines and batteries to last at least a million miles.

And he's checking the boxes one-by-one:

* Durable - [30x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAE_steel_grades#300_Series%E2%80%94austenitic_chromium-nickel_alloys) (stands for three-zero-something, not thirty times) [cold-rolled](https://www.reliance-foundry.com/blog/hot-vs-cold-rolled-steel) stainless steel. [Vinyl skins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_vinyl_wrap). 

* Cheap to make - [XY origami design](https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/elon-musk-explains-cybertrucks-angular-steel-design), [new cabling system](https://electrek.co/2019/07/22/tesla-revolutionary-wiring-architecture-robots-model-y/), no paint job, continuing to improve battery tech ([Maxwell](https://insideevs.com/news/355547/tesla-maxwell-battery-details/), [Hibar](https://cleantechnica.com/2019/10/06/tesla-adds-hibar-systems-to-its-list-of-acquisitions/), etc).

* Last a million miles - [Recent research by Dahn and Tesla patents](https://electrek.co/2019/09/13/tesla-patent-battery-cell-better-performance-cheaper/).

So S3XY CARS (CARS = Cybertruck, ATV, Roadster, Semi) are the complete set of Tesla vehicles to be built assuming human drivers and private ownership.

I'll be new to the tesla ecosystem with the potential purchase of the cybertruck. I notice I can add thr addition of full self driving for $9200 Canadian. To me this is an insane amount of money for so many unknowns. I know everyone says to add it to the order, lock the price in now in case it goes up but even if it stays that price I'm torn. I'll just shoot off some of my main concerns in no order and hopefully I'll get some clarity as I seem to be in the minority with this.

- why does the price go up? Its software based and eventually all cars will have similar functions. Competition will bring pricing down. To me it seems we are funding a kickstarter with too many unknowns.

- even if it works 100%. It will drive 100% road legally  accurate, great, but we all drive different with some bad habits. Sure, this may seem like a positive but how long can you realistically sit in a car driving completely differently than what your used to? From  acceleration to breaking, speed and any other aspect of the driving experience. 

- legalities, will it be allowed everywhere ? Insurance? 

- people say they will use the car as a driverless uber while they are not using it.....right....vandals, damage, hit and runs on the road...issues go on and on

- we already have autopilot standard and will do a majority of the FSD features on the highway and it constantly improves.

408,2018 Model 3 RW Long Range w/ FSD for $40k vs 2016 Model S w/ Enhanced AP and free Supercharging for life for $43k,"Found two vehicles and debating between them. Love the Model S due to interior size (I'm 5' 11"" and 3 feels a little small, especially in the back where I would put 2-3 car seats) and the console. Plus the free Supercharging is a huge plus. But hate the fact that there is no manual release to open the doors from the outside in the case the handles fail. It also has $50k miles on it and doesn't come with FSD (but has the necessary hardware) and only goes 250 miles.

That being said, the Model 3 has FSD AND long range (about $17k worth of upgrades) so goes 325 miles and saves me a ton of money. It also has manual opening doors outside and a manual emergency release on the inside. It also only has 20k miles. But not sure if it will fit 3 booster/car seats for the kids.

They initially didn't want to sell me a pair of their S class chains because they weren't the ones recommended in the Model 3 owners manual. As weather would have it, I needed them, and they seemed to do the trick.

I looked before buying them to see what chains other people bought for their model 3s besides the recommended versions, but I couldn't find much. Figured a little thread here might help others looking find options that work. So, what chains did you use and for which wheel size.

The unlock may not be instant (may take a minute or so for the ""payment"" to clear), but it can happen within reasonable time.

Enter Cybertruck. I think this throws a monkey wrench into Tesla‚Äôs available options with their current prices. At under $40k the base model on the Cybertruck is an incredible value. Myself I‚Äôd go w/ the dual motor but even then you‚Äôre at $50k, new!

432,Winter charging minimum amperage,"I am going to have to have a 240V line installed outside of my garage. I don‚Äôt/can‚Äôt park in the garage so this outlet will be installed for use in the driveway. 

My electrical box is full, so I am going to put this on a new per my electrician‚Äôs suggestions. We have a subpanel with a 50A breaker used for central air (condenser outside and air handler upstairs in attic)... so the plan is to put a 30A breaker on another subpanel that pulls off the air conditioner subpanel. So, a sub-subpanel of sorts. 

Now according to the manuals for my air units I have a combined running load of around 14-15 amperes. But for safety reasons I don‚Äôt want to have this blazing the whole time at maximum. 

I have the ability to monitor and control and program the air conditioning as needed during the warmer months (late May through early September) and here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd like to do:

Have it set to around 15 amps draw through the software on board during cooling season.  This would get me around 14-16 miles per hour of charge in theory. 

In the heating season when cold is a factor increase this in the software to 24A, which nets around 22 miles per hour of charge and minus any loss due to keeping the cabin heated or battery at ideal temperature. I would also precondition the cabin as well. 

I am planning to have the electrician run 6 gauge wire in the event I change the box down the road so I can use higher powered charging, and put a NEMA 14-50 outlet on the outside with a placard that says ‚ÄúMaximum 25A‚Äù or something like that. If that‚Äôs a problem I can have him install a NEMA 14-30. 

My commute is only about  10 miles each way in a 50-50 mix of city and highway:  30-35 mph zone for about 2 miles, 55 mph highway for about 4 miles, 35 mph ‚Äúvery urban‚Äù city driving for about 3 miles, and another brief mile or two at 55 to the parking lot.

467,Biggest surprise of the Cybertruck unveil was the base price.,"So the base price of the Cybertruck is going to be $40k. This is a truck much bigger than the Model X, and made of a special cold-rolled steel alloy.   
The target base price of the Model 3 was $35k. Although Tesla did technically get to that for a short time in Feb 2019 - you could place orders for a $35k Model 3 - they never actually built any cars of that spec. The argument was that not enough were ordered for it to be worth it - so instead they sold the $37k SR+ with software limited range to a limited number of people who had ordered the $35k one. Today the cheapest Model 3 is SR+ at $39,490 because Autopilot is now mandatory.  
So how are they going to hit that $40k Cybertruck price point? And when do you think they are going to do it, given that the more expensive models usually become available first?",teslamotors,1575289985,rosinchard,45,1,True,2019-12-02
468,Help Convincing Spouse We Can Afford Model 3,"Help Convincing Spouse We Can Afford Model 3.

I changed jobs and gave up a company vehicle 6mo this ago and was in need of a second car. Tesla is the only automotive manufacturer I can get on board with but my wife just saw dollar signs when I mentioned my interest. We had a M3 for three days and she loved it. I broke out total cost of ownership per year and how it was comparable to the Subaru Outback we were also considering (only those 2 vehicles). The heart burn came from the monthly payment to finance what was at the time a base show room $54k M3. We live in a northern, harsh winter state and AWD is almost a must. I talked through the weight displacement and how RWD doesn‚Äôt have the same characteristics and only comes into question when accelerating and she still has major concerns (I get a lot of this since the cars are so next level, we have to shed a lot of pre conceived notions). We can afford the yearly cost when factoring fuel, oil changes, fluids, belts, transmission work, but the payments do look tight but accessible (especially given we are on one income with kiddos) 

My questions to the Model 3 owners of Reddit,
-what is the real or unknown cost, or better yet, savings that come with owning a Tesla? (websites savings calculation to total invoice seems a bit unrealistic)

-I have availability to charge for free at on site charging stations at work, would I need to charge at home ever to avoid any impact to utilities? 

-does the increase in utilities compare to fuel in a combustion car?

-Would Tesla take a newer Ford Escape as a trade in like dealerships to help minimize amount financed?

-What hidden maintenance is there that drives cost (if any) 

-Lastly what are some pointers on creating buy in that as expensive as they are, it is more economically responsible in the long term.",teslamotors,1575291944,goombaLu,31,1,True,2019-12-02

18,Visiting showroom for first time,"My family is planning to visit a showroom this weekend (the Colorado ones and the one in KC are unfortunately equally close). Equally close means it's a good  5+ hour drive. Don't get me wrong, we're using the whole weekend as a getaway and plan on doing some other fun things on the way, but I'm worried about travelling far and not getting enough out of the visit to be worthwhile.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm reading reviews online about some people who have experienced showing up at a showroom and being told they had to schedule a test-drive in advance, but others say it's really easy.

I'm hoping to try out both a Model 3 and Model X with my family. I hope testdriving with a couple carseats is allowed? Obviously, testing the car with carseats is pretty logical for us. I also hope it isn't too much to ask to 

I have a little concern about showing up and honestly telling them that I'm not looking to buy yet (rather, plan to get more serious in the summer); do they ignore you or even disallow testdrives to people who they don't perceive as serious shoppers?

Finally, do these showrooms offer much else for simply wanting to learn more about the cars up close, other than test drives?

29,Phones and fobs: inconsistent proximity detection,"TL;DR Just some observations on inconsistent behavior with two phone keys and four new key fobs. It's long, and probably only interesting to a couple of pedantic people who have seen strange behavior with new fobs.

My household has two iPhones we have paired as keys and four of the new-style key fobs (""TESLA"" logo on bottom, has the proximity sensor).

The phones were generally okay before this latest update. Anecdotally, I'd say 80% of the time worked on the 1st try, 15% on the 2nd, and 5% of the time one of us would have to open the app on our phone first and then try. Now with version 2019.32.12.2, we have to open our phone app *every time*.

The fobs are a different story. I'll call them Fob A thru D.

Fob A works as you expect each. and. every. time.

Fob B works every time to open the doors, but never to start the car. I have to either put the fob on the center console or push one of the buttons on the fob. Sometimes shaking or touching the fob helps, but only sometimes.

Fob C does not work right. You have to push a button to open the doors. Pushing the trunk or frunk button will allow the doors to be opened; I'm not sure if the proximity sensor is working or if the fobs without the sensor work the same way. It never hassles me about driving.

Fob D works unreliably. Seems to be 50/50. Regardless of whether it works or not, it never hassles me about starting the car.

And when I say any of them ""don't work"", I mean on the 1st try or the 10th try... I usually have to push the button on the fob (but sometimes shaking it or touching it seems to work.)

Strangely, for all fobs AND phones: auto locking when walking away ALWAYS works.

We'll often go out with one phone (that's usually powered off) and/or fob. I'd say about half the times the fobs weren't working we didn't have a phone with us. Which is interesting because it means 50% of the time the fobs weren't working, the phones weren't, either.

When we tried any two fobs together, they ALWAYS worked.

Side question for anyone who got this far: I can pair key cards with driver profiles, but it won't let me assign them to fobs. Why?",teslamotors,1572477963,DenseGeologist,18,9,True,2019-10-30

Some of you may have seen my Tweet where on my vacation home to NY I got 4 referrals for Model 3's by letting others drive my car. I was even attacked by some TeslaQ idiot saying I was lying (I was not even exaggerating how many in fact) - well one of those was my Grammy who is a firecracker from Brooklyn and loves technology. She fell in love with my Model 3 and ordered one of her own. Only days later she was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung, esophagus, and lymph cancer.

When we ordered, it showed a delivery time of two weeks, and as many of you saw, those times this quarter quickly slipped to 6-10 weeks. Hers was one of those and well, right now every day is a gift. We stayed in communication with her delivery specialist who was very kind and tried everything to find her the one she wanted sooner (White on White Long Range Dual Motor). Finally today we saw she got a Delivery date at the Charlotte store (the nearest one to the house she has chosen to spend retirement in as of a year ago). I was as excited for her as she was! My grandpa even worked with the electrician to have her outlet installed so she can charge it as soon as it arrives. My father, her son (another one of those referrals from my trip) has been answering her questions as he learns new things about his own car. It's been a group effort. 

One of the people I had been chatting with to help get her car, reached out to the Manager at the Charlotte store and she called me. She was so incredibly sweet, and when I asked if they do home delivery (which is apparently too far from the store typically) the manager said: ""Even if I need to myself, we will deliver the car to her - we would be honored to help in any way we can"". I started to cry a bit. 

Here's a company I've loved for years, got a half dozen referrals for - just to help the company thrive in my mind, and they gave me the best thank you that I could have ever gotten by treating my Grandma so well. You've made my whole family cry today Tesla, for the best reason we've had in months. Thank you, to the entire team that has pulled this together. I'm a fan and customer for life.

148,Range mode + Ludicrous Plus? (Taycan v. MS),"Hi Reddit! 

I'm a former Tesla employee and life long performance guy turned Tesla owner/enthusiast after years of launching Ludicrous+.  My job included managing a local showroom fleet - from quality control to vehicle dynamics, I spent the majority of my time driving and demonstrating Teslas of all trims. Of course, the MS P100DL was my favorite and likely driven more than the rest. Hosting demos to win over Porsche, Lamborghini, Mercedes-AMG, BMW M, etc. owners compelled me to always make sure a P100DL was running as close to peak as possible (SOC, pack temp, settings.)

As such, I recall times when attempting to enable Ludicrous+ would fail. The car would go through its warp screen, bring up the Performance readout and a few seconds later would turn off. Ultimately **it turned itself off due to range mode being enabled** in order to deny the expenditure of power for such frivolous purposes (as it should!)

**Can any P100DL owners out there confirm this to still be true?** If this in fact is still the case, this supports the theory that without Ludicrous+ enabled, the battery was not pre-conditioned and launch control was not able to be used.

My vote is for Dragtimes to test the two cars!


TL;DR: Does range mode still override Ludicrous Plus and turn the setting off after 5-10 seconds? This was a detail I noticed during my employment there and would show Top Gear ran the MS wrong.",teslamotors,1572576675,Stickyv35,0,1,True,2019-10-31

This is where the plot thickens.  Just today, they (Tesla support) transferred the car to my Tesla account so I could use the Tesla App, and manage the car on my account.  When I login to my account, I checked to see if possibly FSD was originally purchased with the car as well (as the dealership didn‚Äôt even realize the car has EAP, score!!). But when I look at the upgrade options, I see both FSD ($6000) and Autopilot ($3000) as upgrade options.

Requested a quote on a model 3 as I am in the market for an electric car and the scheme has refused to offer me a quote on a M3 until I am over 30 (currently 29). This is a salary sacrifice scheme that pays for all insurance and tax etc lumped in with the monthly price of the car. I have asked them to justify this decision and they have mentioned its something to do with their insurance provider.

203,[Tesla Visual Neural Net Idea]: Automatic Air Recirculation when Garbage/Dump Truck Detected,"Elon keeps up here, and I haven't seen this idea posted before, so I was hoping we could get some exposure to it.

We all know that feeling when we pull up behind a garbage truck or dump truck (or really, any old smoke spewing vehicle, but that is a bit harder task to train a visual neural net on) and our air recirculation is not enabled and we just got a huge whiff of garbage or exhaust in our face (which is now even more noticeable with our exhaust free cars.)   

**A fairly simple task would be that upon detection of a garbage truck or dump truck in your area, turn on air recirculation until 1 minute after the last detection.** 

Just a small quality of life improvement that wouldn't really need significant development time as they will surely train the visual neural net to better distinguish vehicle types anyway, for tasks such as knowing garbage trucks may stop often and should be passed when safe.",teslamotors,1572624110,Takaa,10,5,True,2019-11-01

This week, my M3 gave me an error message saying that my memory stick's write speed is too slow for TeslaCam. This is puzzling, as the memory stick is USB 3.1 and worked fine before. I've tried removing and reinserting the memory stick; this didn't fix the problem.

If I need to buy a different memory stick, can someone please tell me one that they know works?

215,Tesla should have options to donate trees as a referral award and during the ordering process,"Elon donates 1,000,000 trees which is fantastic and I applaud anyone willing to do something like that. However, the 20,000,000 tree campaign is a one time thing and the world needs many more than that. 

 I‚Äôd love it if Tesla let people opt to donate some number of trees as a referral award in lieu of supercharger credits. For some reason the price for the trees was $1 per tree when I‚Äôve seen non-profits plant trees for 10 cents. It may be possible to donate something on the order of 100-1000 trees if they are 10 cents each instead of receiving 1000 supercharger miles. I‚Äôm sure many people would be happy to do so.

Also, it would be great if we could donate trees during the ordering process or immediately after. Some people may want to do so in order to help offset the carbon in producing their Tesla vehicle or energy products. They could have some default numbers but also allow you to type in whatever number you want. The additional money looks very small during a large purchase and people are trying to be environmentally conscious when making their purchase. 

I think if Tesla did both those things many millions of trees would be donated annually. Especially if they were being planted for 10 cents instead of $1 each. 

Perhaps Elon could even throw a little bit of engineering resources at how to plant trees more efficiently and effectively as a goodwill project. I‚Äôve seen things like tree planting drones. There was a recent study that said planting 1.2 trillion new trees could sequester the last 10 years of total carbon dioxide emissions.  Clearly there could be massive benefits to throwing some effort at this. Plus trees can help beautify many areas and protect wildlife.

After maybe ten click-click sounds, it gives up, but the light stays blinking yellow. The screen in the car indicates that the car is charging.

My 2019 M3 (manufactured July) has an intermittent vibration coming from the dashboard on the driver's side, as far as I can tell. It sounds like this:
https://youtu.be/hQttUptfytI
(apologies for the poor quality)

I previously took the vehicle in for service and this was the report:
""Technician verified customer concern. Upon inspection found upper air vent on driver side making intermittent contact with 
underside of dash pad insulated as best as possible and test drove under the same conditions used to verify concern and 
vibration no longer present.""

Whatever the tech did, it may have helped some (the problem seemed to go away for a few weeks) but it's creeping back again (as can be heard in that video).
I feel like the way they ""fixed"" this was a patch to begin with, so I can't say I'm surprised. Something about the assembly of my dash seems bad and it's weird to me they need to make post factory modifications to address it.

Just wanted to get your folks' take on this. If anyone had a similar problem and can provide guidance that would be great. 
The annoying thing is this is an intermittent issue so it's hard to catch. Got another service appointment coming up but honestly not expect anything at this point. This would be the 3rd attempt at repairing this.",teslamotors,1572680121,dandandanny,39,12,True,2019-11-02

There's a chance that you might read this, so here are few bullet points:-

1) Having a direct interface with you helps us bypass the FUD. 

2) This interface helps the like minded good people to form a community around you. 

3) Maybe pay someone to create a simple twitter like platform where we can all join. No bells and whistles needed.

302,Why would someone think this was ok? PHL airport,"I'll preface it by saying I wish I took a picture but I did not.

Had a business trip this week. Had to fly out for about 2 days. Got to the airport around 5am (phl). Noticed on chargepoint app that there was an open charger in the D terminal. I was flying out of D as well.  Perfect. Chargers are ""free"" as well. I say ""free"" because parking is $24 / day. Economy is $11 / day but I had a 55lb luggage I had to check. I didn't feel like lugging it on the shuttle bus. 

Anyway let's not debate the wisdom of having chargers in an airport parking lot. It's not the smartest thing since they could be sitting there with a fully charged car for a few days until you return from your trip. A large bank of level 1 chargers would be much better imo. 

I have a 17 volt. Saw the open charger and plugged in. I came back about 36 hours later and found a note under my wiper. It said "" don't park here if you're aren't fully electric ""insulting term"""".  At this point there were two open chargers. There was a model 3 next to me and a model s parked down at the end of the same row. I'm not saying it was a Tesla owner who left a note. It must have been someone who has an ev tho. So is anyone here willing to fess up? Feel free to pm me. 

Would anyone else feel like it was ok to leave that note?",teslamotors,1572700259,turbodsm,0,1,True,2019-11-02

305,Tesla - skeezy business practices or bait and switch?,"Several members of my extended family drive Tesla cars and only speak its praises, and when I test drove one of their model 3s I realized I wanted one as well, if my financial situation could accommodate one.¬† The software updates, the self driving capabilities, no need to waste time filling up gas and also being environmentally friendly? Count me in.¬†¬†

I recently changed jobs that required me to relocate across the country to Maryland, so the pay bump and my desire for a sweet car tipped me to finally order one online last month.¬† I picked out my color Midnight Silver and the Long-Range dual motor option and paid the deposit.¬† I got a call from Tesla representative Michael that confirmed I could pick it up on October 31.¬† I get a VIN for insurance, everything seemed set.

Two weeks ago I noticed they had written the pickup date as October 22, a week before I would even be in Maryland, so I called Tesla rep Michael and he confirmed the date would be changed to the date we agreed on earlier.

Then October 30th rolls around and right as I fly into Maryland I get a call from Tesla Michael, telling me my car has been sold to someone else.¬† Obviously shocked, I asked what could be done, and he mentioned I should call the Rockville Tesla Sales Center Brian to get things sorted out.¬† I called them all day without ever getting an answer from them, and finally got an email from Brian curtly telling me to talk to Michael for other options.

The next day Michael emails me apologizing and promising me that I can get a loaner vehicle in the meantime from Brian.¬† However shortly afterwards another curt email from Brian stated ""we do not have loaners to just give out for long periods of time due to delays from the factory."" But this was not due to a delay from the factory, this was due to them selling my car (which I already had a VIN for and set up insurance) out from under me!¬†¬†

I called Michael and he told me that unfortunately it will take 6-8 weeks to get a new car from the factory.¬† I obviously need a car for to drive to my new job and cannot wait that long.¬† However there is a Tesla available in Alabama that can be shipped here in 8 days.¬† I have to pay an extra 2500 since it is a performance model, although it's lacking performance wheels and spoiler and should look the same as a regular model 3.¬† So it's either wait 6-8 weeks, or pay an extra 2500 dollars for a ""performance"" car that looks the same as a regular model 3?¬† And I still have to rent a car and wait 8 days until I get it, if I get it?

They mentioned I could get $500 worth at the Tesla store, although there's nothing there that I want (it doesn't include supercharging).

So I need to rent a car and pay $2500 extra for a car I already had.¬† The fact that Tesla screwed up and caused a lot of trouble for me, and yet doesn't seem to be willing to be accommodating at all seems troubling.¬† Especially since I have to pay an additional 2500 for an upgrade i didn't want for a car that looks the same? Is this a bait and switch?

I asked it to charge to 100% overnight and it's only coming up with 333km instead of 386km -- 85% of the 'rated' charge. I expected a 4-6% degradation, but 15% seems like a lot.

It also seems to drop pretty fast as i start driving.

Not sure if it's battery related or just because it's a bit colder outside right now (~8-9 C during the day and 0-1 C during the night).

Having 0 experience with a tesla, does the reported range drop when it's cold, or is the battery degraded by 15%. They assured me the vehicle was inspected and with warranty when i got it and never gave me ""how degraded is the battery"" percent before buying it.

336,Tesla Insurance Clarifying Questions,"Hi all,

We are looking into getting a Model 3 SR+ (no FSD), and as we were running down the list of costs, Insurance came up. Traditionally, insurance has been pretty high, especially because we have a teenager driving. Current car is a Chevy Bolt '17, and rates are waayyy up there. Never had a crash/accident (knock on wood), and have a clean driving history (1 ticket 5 years ago). Live in SoCal, three drivers including one teen.

After hearing about Tesla Insurance, and that it is cheaper than Geico, I had some coverage-related questions. I can't get a quote until I buy the car, so here we go: 

Firstly, what is the actual coverage? I've looked around a bit and have found the deductible to be $500 and the total liability to be $100,000. Is this correct? Does it vary? What other packages are offered? 

Second, have there been any issues in auto-pay? I have seen some people saying that the payment dodn't go through (or something like that). Is this fixed? 

Third, if someone has any sort of relation to my situation, is there any way you can give me an estimate on insurance price?

Finally, how much of the actual ""customizing"" or changing of info can you do online vs. calling in?

The call center I was directed to said that they can't quote me until I have a reservation or deposit for a car. Sorry if this seems redundant!

364,How we can get the share price of Tesla to where it should be and help Elon secure funding for his many endeavors,"tl;dr at the bottom

As we all know, Tesla does no longer receive a significant federal tax credit on sales. Manufacturers like VW, Audi, Toyota etc. who not only gave all the burden and risk of pioneering electric vehicles to a startup, but also cheated on emissions regulations with the full knowledge of upper management, still reiceive 7,500$ per sale (technically it goes to the buyer, but you know what I am trying to say). Go figure, the playing field is no longer level and fair in the US, Tesla‚Äôs biggest market.

We need an EV tax credit which is not limited by the amount of sales, as well as a carbon tax, to accelerate the transition to a sustainable future. 

How can we make sure this will be implemented?

Next year there is going to be a presidential election, which will decide the future of US policies concerning climate change. 

Elon tweeted ‚ÄûI support Yang‚Äú (democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang).

Andrew Yang is not only very tech savy, but also strongly in favor of exploring all ways to fight the climate crisis we all will have to face. He is definitely pro tax credit and also proposes a carbon tax on his policy page. This would help secure the funding for the future endeavors of Tesla, SpaceX and all the other exciting enterprises Elon will come up with. 

tl;dr: Please upvote and comment on this post, so Elon sees it and does another JRE with presidential candidate Andrew Yang. Yang is the best candidate to help Tesla and therefore Elon.

PS: Elon, if you have a chance to take some time out of your busy schedule and spill exclusive info about the Pickup truck/Model Y/Starship during a JRE with Andrew Yang, it could help Tesla immensely.

379,Questions before buying Model S (UK),"Hi All,

I took a test drive 2 weeks ago and I am sold, granted I drove a 2019 model but I was really impressed with everything about the car, the fact I can charge at home and not have to worry about buying diesel ever again. The ride was smooth and I love gadgets most of all plus I love anything smart from lights to vacuum to mower etc. Having driven both the Model 3 and the Model 3, I am still in favour of the S coming from a BMW 5 series I prefer the bigger and wider car to the smaller Model 3 etc. I wasn't planning on buying a brand new Model S due to depreciation in the first 3 years although it seems the Model 3 might hold its value better even after 3 years etc. 

So I am looking to buy from Tesla's used inventory , I placed an order for a blue 2015 model S with 35K on the clock. I have not done anything further than paying the initial deposit, I was expecting actual photos of the car as I requested one in an email  but I haven't received anything yet from Tesla, I understand I will only get to see the Car on the pick date, 

Can anyone with better knowledge tell me what those details actually means, what can the **Autopilot with convenience features** means?

* No - 19"" Wheels with Nokian Winter Tyres

 Warranty

* 2 year, 100,000 miles limited warranty
* 3 year, infinite miles battery and drive warranty

I would love the summon and autopilot features , also will the car have the 360 camera so it can record videos of its surroundings when its parked unattended?

Only reason I am buying from Tesla is because of warranty, if I find a private sale with Tesla's warranty left, is that a bad idea?

Can Tesla extend this 2/3 year warranty if I wanted?, any idea of potential cost of this or not worth buying an extended warranty. I am slightly worried once the car is out of warranty and been an electric car, it might be impossible to get repairs done anywhere else but at Tesla, are there any experiences with people owning Teslas that are how of warranty and what are the issues they have encountered etc, repair cost etc. 

Will this also come with the sim card to connect to Tesla's network etc.

403,Tesla autopilot prevents accident with coyote,"[https://youtu.be/VE2sKm0JYH4](https://youtu.be/VE2sKm0JYH4) 

Fall is here and we decided to take advantage of the gorgeous weather and take a day trip to nearby Louisville, Kentucky.

After an amazing day of exploring the city, (and even getting free charging in one of the parking garages) it was around 8:30 pm and dark; it time to head back home. We entered our home address into the navigation and hopped on I-71N and began the roughly 90 minute drive home.  At about the halfway mark, on a very dark section of 71-north, without warning, a coyote suddenly decided to try and cross the highway. The creature and I locked eyes and I braced for what I thought would be an inevitable accident. Mind you, this all happened within 1-2 seconds.   

Luckily for my family, Tesla Autopilot was able to see the coyote, swerve the car to miss it, and correctly put us right back into our lane. Again, this all happened in the matter of mere seconds. The car reacted before I could and anticipated the correct course of action. Because of Tesla, my family wasn't involved in an accident on the expressway on a dark, cold fall night.

What a moment. What a car! In addition to the safety features, I've traveled over 11,000 miles in almost 5 months of ownership and the car continues to amaze me. Thank you to the team at Tesla for creating the most advanced and safest car you can drive on the planet.

407,Model 3 MR RWD winter tires speed rating,"Hi all.

Could be a silly question but having trouble understanding the speed ratings for these.

Looking to pick up some winter tires and found the below on sale at Canadian Tire (hopefully link works):

https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/tires/pdp/continental-wintercontact-si-plus-tire-0052152p.1080035.html

Size looks correct at 235/45R18 (planned on putting these on aero wheels and tossing the covers back on.

I dropped into the store and they said that these are not suitable due to the ""H"" speed rating...

My limited knowledge of speed ratings tells me that these should still be just fine.. as H is still good for 210km/hr.

Is there any issue with me buying and using these tires? Is this just Canadian Tire trying to match up speed ratings with my stock tires as a CYA thing?

438,Considering a Model 3 // Looking for unbiased input,"I drive about 100 miles a day for work. I bought my 2014 Mitsubishi Mirage new and it just hit 150k miles. I'd have a year left on the loan if I hadn't been more aggressive in paying it off--just a few months left now. I've been good about maintenance, doing basic things myself (oil, brakes, etc.) and it's in pretty good shape, but at this point it isn't even worth trading in. It does make some concerning noises that even the dealership won't make recommendations on (citing ""We haven't seen a lot of new Mirages with this many miles on it"" and ""Unless the engine light is on..."" something about accurately diagnosing a problem). I'm about to take a 1300 mile relocation road trip and I'm concerned it might not make it, primarily because my frame of reference for cars is that 100k miles is about when they start falling apart (but maybe that's due to negligence? I've heard of cars lasting much longer).

&amp;#x200B;

So my primary concerns are fuel cost, maintenance, and vehicle life expectancy.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I'm reading that electricity is cheaper than petrol. If that's true, there's a pretty clear winner there.

\-I'm not a car guy, but I've learned a few basic skills to save money. Not sure if the skills are transferable since Teslas don't use oil or need to have their brakes replaced as frequently. I'm sure tire rotations are still a thing, but even if I'm saving money on fuel, if I have to have a professional do every bit of maintenance, the savings may be offset.

\-I don't want to have to buy a car every 5 years if I can help it, especially if I'm racing against the loan to pay it off before it's worthless. I remember my wife saying that the battery capacity of a Tesla only loses 10% after 100k miles. I vaguely remember seeing that they have a higher resell value than other cars of comparable cost--not that I would want to resell it, but just the idea that it's still useful beyond the point that other cars are is a plus.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Bonus: I really like the idea of the self-driving feature. I miss my exit a lot when I'm talking.

441,How the Tesla Key Card works,"Howdy everyone.

So I started attempting to reverse-engineer my Tesla Key Card last week, and I'm rather surprised with how much progress I've made. I'm not sure how I seem to be the first person to do this publicly, but a Google search for the magic string `teslaLogic002` doesn't seem to turn up any results other than for my own research. (That's the AID of the authentication applet on the card, by the way)

I've got a whole writeup (along with hacking notes) in a [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/darconeous/2cd2de11148e3a75685940158bddf933), but here are a few of the interesting takeaways:

* Authentication appears to use Elliptic-curve Diffie‚ÄìHellman (ECDH) on the famous NIST P-256 curve. The mechanism appears to be secure-in-theory. The card is at least rejecting points that aren't on the P-256 curve, so that's good. 
* Each card has four(!) ECDH keys. The vehicle only uses the first ECDH key on the card. I have no idea what the other three might be used for.
* Each vehicle has its own ECDH key which it sends to the card to authenticate, along with a 128-bit random challenge. The card responds with a 128-bit response to complete the authentication.
* Each card has its own X.509 certificate, which the vehicle does not fetch (even at pairing). There is only a certificate for the first ECDH key‚Äîall other keys are missing certificates.

I've already mapped out several APDU commands, and give how straightforward this effort has been so far I think it might be possible to eventually write a custom JavaCard app that would work with the car. If that gets figured out then it should also be possible to add support for Tesla Key Cards to some physical access control systems. The exact details of the authentication step still need to be figured out, but I'm optimistic that it can be figured out given how easily things have gone so far.

466,Tesla should sell managed solar power plants (incl. batteries) and deploy them themselves as well,"So you might have noticed that the transition to renewable energy is going rather slowly. Even if solar and wind (+batteries) are cost-competitive, many energy companies have invested heavily in fossil fuels and thus need to amortize their costs. This slows the necessary change down. To fast track it, Tesla should sell a complete solar power plant as a product, including battery storage. 

This power plant would not only generate energy but also intelligently trade it on the energy market, utilizing its battery storage. This would not only produce another profit but actually stabilize the grid.

Tesla should also sell this in a ‚Äúmanaged‚Äù version, like a server farm. Customers basically give Tesla money and get the profits in return. Tesla deploys, maintains, and manages the plant for them. 

This would serve multiple ends:

* The adoption of renewable energy is fastened, as it becomes easier to invest in it. I could even imagine crowd-investing.
* The adoption of renewable energy is fastened, as it (further) demonstrates the economic viability of the concept.
* The cost of solar and batteries decreases because higher volumes are produced, thanks to the [Experience Curve effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_curve_effects)
* Tesla's mission is supported.
* The image of EVs is improved as the counter-argument of ‚ÄúEVs use fossil fuel electricity‚Äù is weakened.

Now, if Tesla sells a product that basically prints money and only needs some capital investment‚Ä¶what stops them from just deploying their own solar plants? Nothing!

Just as SpaceX creates its own demand for its new Starship by creating the Starlink network and out-competing its old customers (at least some of them), Tesla can create its own demand for batteries and solar. They just need some capital, and ta-da, money is printed. Since profit margins are internalized, Tesla gains an additional cost advantage.

As solar and battery technology is on an exponential trend ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwSkQa1tNmE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwSkQa1tNmE)) as soon as cost competitiveness is reached, Tesla can out-compete fossil fuels and force them out of the market. This price point is however already reached in many regions!

This whole strategy would be in line with Elon's comments that Tesla might become a global utility company due to sold solar roofs and battery storage. The market opportunity is also huge. But I have no further evidence, so this remains a moonshot idea ( [u/galileorussell](https://www.reddit.com/u/galileorussell/) )",teslamotors,1572857742,DarmokAndJaladAtTana,27,53,True,2019-11-04

478,Customer service have been giving me the run around for 6 months.,"My Model 3 was delivered in March. I live in Michigan and had to drive to Cleveland to pick up the car. They told me it would take 45 day to get the registration stuff figured out so I can register it in Michigan and give my bank the title. Long story short, they gave me the run around for 3 months bc they kept screwing it up but lying about it or not returning my calls. Bank started calling me about it, wanting the title or they were gonna default my loan. Once they finally got my registration fixed, they promised me a free Tesla wall connector for the terrible customer service. They stated this in email. Since June, I‚Äôve been getting the run around again and they refuse to let me speak to a manger. It‚Äôs 2 hrs away and can‚Äôt simply drop in.

493,all of the renders for a Tesla pickup truck are awful.,"So far I havent seen any render of a Tesla pickup truck that isnt a dead on arrival product due to just plain ugliness. 

I've been firmly on the Tesla train for awhile and was really hoping for an alternative to my next gas guzzling ecoboost Ford F150.

I dont need a frunk but it would be nice. But I need it to fit in my driveway at least. The new render shows it being 3 times the size of a normal vehicle. 

Maybe these are just PR campaigns but it's not giving me more confidence in the truck. I want a Tesla truck but...it needs to be comparable in design to an actual truck. 

I'm hoping that this post gets to show up on this subreddit because somehow somewhere I want to say this out loud to someone from Tesla.

Removed from vehicle_state (for Model 3):

    sun_roof_percent_open     : 
    sun_roof_state            : unknown

The new defrost_mode changes from 0 to 2 when enabled in the app and 2 to 0 when disabled.  Initial power draw on max defrost is between 6.5-6.7 kW (with the driver seat heater on low) and the ""max"" temperature setting corresponds to 28¬∞C.  The full list of API changes caused by enabling max defrost on my car is as follows:

    9/30/2019 12:15:05 PM  Roadrunner.climate_state.defrost_mode changed from 0 to 2

    9/30/2019 12:15:05 PM  Roadrunner.climate_state.seat_heater_left changed from 0 to 1
    9/30/2019 12:15:10 PM  Roadrunner.climate_state.is_auto_conditioning_on changed from False to True
    9/30/2019 12:15:25 PM  Roadrunner.charge_state.charger_phases changed from  to 1

**homelink_device_count** has been added, but I'm unsure what context it's used for within the Tesla app at this time. 

The new window states appear to be 0 if closed, 1 if vented, and 2 if partially or fully opened.  Annoyingly, the naming convention of the windows (fd_, fp_, rd_, rp_) is inconsistent with the door/trunk states (df, dr, pf, pr, ft, rt).

The new software_update states **download_perc** and **install_perc** appear to be integers from 0-100 representing progress.  **version** is likely the next version to be updated to.

Interestingly, looking back through my change log I spotted a couple of other transient or vestigial API changes in previous versions that went unnoticed until now.  The car reports a wiper blade heater turning on along with side mirror heaters when rear defrost is enabled, despite no wiper heater being present in the Model 3:

    9/27/2019 17:24	 Roadrunner.climate_state.is_front_defroster_on changed from False to True
    9/27/2019 17:24	 Roadrunner.climate_state.is_rear_defroster_on changed from False to True

    9/27/2019 17:27	 Roadrunner.climate_state.wiper_blade_heater changed from True to False

And for one minute on August 18th, the drive_state took on a bunch of extra fields, most of which were copies of the ones from vehicle_config, but one new field denoting trim badging where the Model 3 AWD briefly reported as **74d**.  

    8/18/2019 0:18	 Roadrunner.drive_state.trim_badging changed from  to 74d

I want a specific ‚Äúbuild‚Äù. A ‚Äústealth‚Äù Model 3. All the zoomies, but no carbon wing, red calipers or lowered height.

So I‚Äôm on the phone with that friendly guy, and he finds me one. It‚Äôs blue, but I don‚Äôt care. I can get it wrapped anyway. So I go for it. I pay the advance, and it gets linked to my account.

He tells me I‚Äôll get a call to arrange delivery. Which I get. But I‚Äôm in a meeting, so I call back. Yet another friendly person picks up.

After going back and forth a bit, I feel somethings off. I ask him directly and his response is as following. ‚ÄúThe car you purchased mistakingly showed up in the system. It‚Äôs not available anymore‚Äù

Ah, shoot. But, sh*t happens, and I‚Äôm not a difficult person, so we go over other options. He finds another one. A grey one! With nicer rims! I‚Äôm a bit happy, because I like that more. He even gives me a deal on the rims and color, because they made an error.

Days go by. I don‚Äôt see the grey one pop up in my app, so I get a bit worried. Gues I‚Äôll give them a call.

The friendly person picks up. Again, bit back and forth, and I feel he‚Äôs dragging. I ask about it, and he goes: That car is not available anymore.

I‚Äôm getting annoyed. I don‚Äôt want to yell at him, so I hung up. I immediatly call the first person, whom I had seen in real life, to explain the situation.

He is flabbergasted. ‚ÄúHow could this have happend‚Äù. We immediatly find a replacement, a black one, but I now have to pay more, for less options. I try to pull some benefits out of this ordeal, but to no avail. I‚Äôm at the point of cancelling the whole operation, because I‚Äôve been sinking too much time into this.

I ran to the bank twice already, and the insurance company twice too. I had to tell them they‚Äôd have to do it all over again for a third time.

But I‚Äôve got my mind set on it. So I push through. I‚Äôd be getting a black Model 3, with nice rims and a Performance upgrade. I want it.

Fast forward to delivery. I show up a tad early. No problem, I can work mobile. Eventually I get to see the car. After 1.5 hours.

It‚Äôs not charged 100%, only 50%. It‚Äôs been cleaned in a rush. White residue all over the place from the protective stickers.

I inspect the car further. A lot of dings and scratches catch my eye. The bottom‚Äôs damaged, the front lip too. It clearly scraped. Small scuffs here and there.

The salesperson takes pictures and assures me it‚Äôll get fixed. Tesla Service will contact me for an appointment.

So I drive my newly aqcuired car to work. After 20 km‚Äôs, I get a  notification. Wheel pressure is off on all 4 wheels. It jumps to 1 wheel, back to 4, to go to 2 wheels.

This happens, especially with new tires. You just have to record the new pressure in the system. Which I did. To no avail. I carry on driving.

I hit the highway. Clean straight driving. And I notice something else. The steeringwheel‚Äôs not straight. It sits at a tiny angle. I do some more tests and yes, when holding the whee straight, the car pulls left. That‚Äôs not aligned well.

I arrive at my work‚Äôs parking lot. I put it in reverse. The camera pops up, but I hear no sounds. Weird. I also notice I‚Äôm not getting distance readings on my screen. I quickly look up the issue of not having parking sensors, and after a reset... still nothing.

God, I really want to like this car.

Now I ended with my ‚Äúthird‚Äù Tesla, scuffed and scratched, dirty as hell, no parking sensores, a plethora of warnings and an angled steeringwheel.

54,Here is Model 3 SR+ summary Read before you buy," 

Hello everyone, so I currently own Porsche Cayenne and Hyundai Sonata-

Porsche is my date night/events car, or if I want to enjoy some good sound while riding in style- occasionally drive it to work on Friday's. Hyundai, I use this for grocery shopping, driving to work and ride share. Had to talk to the wife and show her cost/benefit analysis of switching to electric- we are both young (early 30's) so accepting and adapting to changes in the technological age is not a hard sell to us. She wants the X because we have a 7- seater ICE car for now.

1. If you really want a Tesla Model 3 for those of you that don't have it yet, go to Tesla, schedule to have a rental overnight. All you need is show them DL and insurance, they won't charge you a penny!
2. Before you invest in FSD make sure the one you get has this feature, use it 50/50 while driving. The FSD is still in Beta Mode- the most thing I enjoyed about it is self-parking. But while driving It kind of freaked me out when you reach the red light and you are the one in front. The car WON'T stop! so you will be ready to stop it yourself, sure it'll switch lane's when you signal, but that is the only two things FSD does for now (self park and switch lanes when you signal-oh summon mode). For these reasons, **I don't feel like spending $6,000 for FSD** until it can recognize traffic lights and stop (completely my opinion)
3. Sound on SR+: I know a lot of audiophiles like myself are worried about the sound because of no sub- I was shocked that the audio in the SR+ is almost as good as the audio from my Porsche (the Porsche has bose sound). The SR+ sound does **NOT** suck, again for this reason, I don't think it is worth it for premium interior (10k more!), the only reason for spending that much would be for range 310 miles- however, who truly needs 300+miles /day?? sure road trips etc- but there are almost 3k supercharges in US alone, and you are supposed to take breaks when driving so that range does not bother me.
4. Interior: you can't tell the diff between SR+ or LR premium- and get the aero wheels, it improves the range!
5. the SR+ does qualify for premium rides on lfyt/uber if you want to occasionally drive- for my Porsche, I do executive airport drops, make about $300/week- wait times are bit longer but it is worth it in my opinion.

So in a nutshell, if you can afford to ditch ICE, do it for the environment, I will also be saving $12,000 on gas in 5 years of owning the model 3! ( cost me $50/month to charge- but gas I spend $250/month!)...if you want a referral code to get your free 2k supercharging free you can inbox me- have a great day everyone!",teslamotors,1569877730,Thearcngel,102,20,True,2019-09-30

67,Tesla Crashed My New P3D 1 Hour Before Delivery Today...," Today, after much fanfare and excitement, was supposed to be the day that I picked up my Tesla Model 3 AWD Dual Motor Performance Car. I had been saving up for so long to make this purchase, and I was finally able to save up enough in time to meet the deadline for the 2 years of free supercharging promotion which ends September 30th. On top of that, I was lucky enough to place a reserve on the last White P3D in stock. After placing my deposit, I eagerly awaited delivery.  


Unfortunately, today I got a call from Tesla in Fremont CA stating that they had had an incident with my vehicle, and that a collision with an object had damaged my car. I was devastated. They told me that there was nothing they could do with regards to getting me a replacement, because¬†there is no more white in stock, but worst of all, they told me that they would not be able to honor the free 2 years of supercharger promotion, even if I waited until they found me a replacement.¬†

I'm hoping that there is somebody in Corporate or Executive at Tesla who can make this right. I put down my deposit, was ready with check in hand to purchase the car of my dreams, and Tesla crashed my car.

73,"Thank you, Tesla","This weekend my father passed away. I was on a road trip in the interior of BC when I got the call from my sister. Multiple cardiac arrests. He was currently on life support, but there was no expectation of recovery.  


I had been awake since 1am that morning because our 1 year old had been quite sick, and spent about 7 hours on the road at that point. We quickly turned around to head back home, and while there was no way to make it back before he passed, I am wholly convinced that without autopilot I would not have been able to make it back. I was very tired, and it was stupid of me to drive back in my condition, wrought with grief and exhaustion, but I made it.  


I found a text message in his phone to a friend that night, bragging about how awesome he thought the car was and how proud he was of me.

I rented a McLaren 720S for the weekend (I can answer questions if anyone is interested by any chance), what's amazing and shocking to me was getting back to my Model 3 afterwards it felt like a completely new car with a bunch of things I never noticed before:

1.	The seating position was amazing. It felt like driving a SUV with all the height and visibility I ever needed.

2.	For people who think the Model 3 handles sharp with a suspension that's on the firmer side, go drive a supercar like the 720S. In comparison driving my AWD Model 3 felt like...driving a pillow stuffed with cloud, in the best and worst way possible. 

3.	My Model 3's cabin insulation might as well be a Rolls Royce when compared to the 720S. It's good to be able to listen to music at less than max volume or talk to your passenger without raising your voice on the highway.

4.	The McLaren was getting something like 14 mpg on mixed highway/local driving (granted I wasn't exactly driving in an...economical manner), in contrast my Model 3 might as well be running on the anguish and tear of oil companies.

5.	The brakes in the Model 3 are much more sensitive and natural for daily driving, even discount the regen factor. The carbon ceramic brakes on the McLaren was... well let's just say stepping on the brakes does almost nothing...then...still almost nothing... and then it does **EVERYTHING**. I almost made the cars behind me rear end me a few times by stepping on the brakes too hard after getting into my Tesla.

6.	The Model 3 is *probably* faster and quicker...up to 15mph. Without launch control the 0-15mph part in the 720S feels like a Camry due to lack of rear traction and the turbo lag...then from 15-120 it feels like getting rear ended by a bullet train on AP1 (hur hur), along with all the violence, exhaust/engine noise and sound of the terrified screams of the my passenger. People laugh in my Model 3 when I floor it. They cry when I do the same in the McLaren, so not recommended as a Lyft/Uber vehicle.

7.	I think the Model 3 has more internal storage space than every single model under McLaren...combined (I'm actually dead serious on this).

76,"Model 3 Performance - Switch from 20"" wheels?","Hey guys, I'm a recent (proud, in love) owner of a 2018 Model 3 Performance. (P3D? Is that the correct nomenclature?)

I love everything about it but I'm not crazy about the 20"" performance wheels it came with - not a big fan of their appearance (I think the stock without aero caps looks better), not a fan of the stiffer ride and not a fan of the loss in mileage (is this true or just a myth? I have a 60mi roundtrip for work and intermittent access to charging, so any gains in mileage would be welcome).

Is there anything I need to keep in mind when switching these wheels/tires out? Can I just put the stock 18"" aeros on them? (I have the upgraded brakes w/ performance package, not sure if that's an issue).

I've also heard of 19"" Tesla wheels, are these jsut larger versions of the aeros? 

As you can tell, I am new to all of this. If someone could help me out or just point me in the right direction I'd greatly appreciate it.

85,[Suggestion] Tesla's navigation should better estimate how HVAC (heat) impacts range,"It's starting to get cold again and I'm thinking about the inconveniences of cold climate driving (having initially gotten my model 3 just over a year ago). The only time I felt any range anxiety was during road trips last winter. I wish Tesla's navigation would better estimate how HVAC use impacts the range. Specifically the heat, the AC doesn't seem to hurt the range nearly as badly.

It's frustrating and stressful to be driving any reasonably long distance and have the navigation initially estimate you'll reach your destination with like 23% battery remaining and after an hour of driving it's dropped all the way to 6%. You have no idea how much further it's going to keep dropping and it can significantly change your travel plans.

Tesla must have some idea how (in)efficient the heater is. They could just calculate the effect based on the current exterior temperature and interior climate control setting. This would alleviate any range anxiety, and could allow for better planning of charging stops and range.

I know a workaround is to turn off the HVAC and turn on the seat heaters. Yeah, that sort of works for me personally, but it can still get very cold and it's hard to force upon other people. I can't imagine my buddy telling his wife and young daughter that. (Side note: Bonus points for tesla if they would update the range live between HVAC on and off so you could make a decision if it was worth it to deal with the cold, just using the seat heater.)

Anyway, thoughts?

**tl;dr:** Tesla's navigation should better estimate how HVAC impacts range using the exterior temperature and interior climate control settings. Cold climate range anxiety is real, this would significantly help alleviate it.",teslamotors,1569884852,EvanVanVan,89,135,True,2019-09-30

108,Serious concerns about Tesla‚Äôs smart summon,"Email I sent to Tesla:

Greetings,

I love my Tesla Model 3 and enjoy the many safety features it offers.  I enjoyed being part of the early access program testing smart summon since April.  After careful responsible use of the official public facing release over the last week, I am concerned that the future is not ready for public use. I have seen many instances when my car has done unexpected and unsafe things in a relatively calm parking lot situation. I have also seen many videos online of people using smart summon in much more risky and dangerous situations. Many videos show people smart summoning their car without it in their line of sight.

I experienced my car damaging it‚Äôs self during the beta of smart summon.  A car is a non living thing.  A person being hit or a car with people in it being hit would be a different story.

I want Tesla to be successful. I am afraid that this feature is going to create serious problems for the company and for the safety of the public.

Thanks for your consideration,",teslamotors,1569895761,SolarRoof,3,0,True,2019-09-30

140,Interesting new electric motor design reaches mass production capability,"They talk about this being much more efficient (per weight) than, for example, the motor in the i3:

&gt;One of our designs has a peak power density of around 15 kilowatts per kilogram. Compare that with today‚Äôs motors, such as the one in the all-electric BMW i3, which delivers a peak power density of 3 kW/kg‚Äîor just one-fifth as much. And the Magnax machine is also more efficient.

Obviously a lot of weight comes from the batteries, and that technology is also improving. But there is still a significant weight in the motors, and this technology promises a way to cut that down as well. It is great to see other players in the market also pushing the efficiency boundary!

178,Could a Model 3 fly (I can't post a question mark in a title because it will get deleted),"No, seriously.  A Cessna Skylane is a very, very popular aircraft which has been produced since the 1950s.  It's powered by a 540 cubic inch engine rated at ~300hp at sea level.  Cruise at 75% power yields 225hp.   It weighs in at a whopping 440lbs


The model 3 rear motor easily matches these specifications and apparently has some very good cooling design which would likely be able to tolerate 75% power for a long duration.  


Apart from the obvious weight of the batteries, could it fly?

RPMs in an aircraft are generally around 2500 and cooling is a lot easier at 150mph.  What would the failure modes be?   Automotive conversions have typically suffered from bearing issues and inability to tolerate high power conditions for sustained periods (car engines aren't made to run continuously at 75% but rather 15 or 20% on the highway).",teslamotors,1569942858,YukonBurger,0,1,True,2019-10-01

201,Tesla not honoring deal,"TL:DR- purchased a Tesla model 3 with 2 years free supercharging and 2 free deviations. Now they will not give me the 2 years free charging. 

I purchased a model 3 a few weeks ago, while the promotion was 2 free deviations &amp; 2 years  of free supercharging. This was told to me verbally by two different sales representatives (I know, should have been in writing.) So I purchased the vehicle on those terms. Upon delivery, the 2 free deviations were honored (paint &amp; rim upgrade). I went to a supercharger and it charged me $7. I called the sales representative and asked what is going on. They informed me that the promotion changed before I took delivery, but after I put the deposit on the vehicle. I have been going back and forth with the sales representatives where they said they will not give me the free supercharging and that I was lucky that I got the deal I received. The sales representatives told me they called every client to inform them about this change, but they forgot to call me. This is a mistake by the sales representative and I believe they are trying to cover their asses by trying to brush this off. I sent emails to tesla, I have been waiting for a response for a few days now. As much as I love the car, the customer service has been god awful.

1. Autopilot definitely will bias away from large trucks and buses. I think this is being done visually rather than with radar because the car starts shifting over before it gets into radar range.

It actually made me a little uncomfortable with how close I got to the car on the left, but maybe it‚Äôs just because it‚Äôs new behavior.

Post collision - airbags were deployed, hazards came on, but the car started to reverse itself quite quickly - looking at the dashcam vendor of the car behind my friends. It reversed in a diagonal alignment, not maintain the lane markings ultimately colliding with the dashcam vehicle. 

Smoke was coming out of the car and my friend was trying to get out of the car.

Any idea why the vehicle would reverse post collision, is that typical?",teslamotors,1569953526,ireland352,0,1,True,2019-10-01
212,"Have test drives on Saturday, what's my buying experience going to be like?","Sorry for the ignorance!  I've never been to a Tesla show room, we live 270 miles from the closest one. I've heard the experience was non-traditional but there doesn't seem to be any good way to Google the answer and the website is a void. 

We're taking an overnight trip to Seattle this weekend to test drive a Model S LR and a Model 3P.  The test drives are scheduled for late morning. I've got 2 young kids and the wife in tow so time is of the essence. 

Considering I've recently had to go through the extended nightmare of a traditional car dealership's buying experience, how is it any different at Tesla?  Will this take forever?  Will they badger me to keep me from walking off the lot?  How thorough are the test drives?

264,"Another Tesla Model 3 driving experience tonight, Thanks Ted!","I saw a neighbor of mine in a Tesla model 3 one day pulling into my apartment complex. I reached out to the message board on our community website and Ted responded kindly and offered for me to check out his ride. His is not a performance model, but the acceleration is absolutely intoxicating. 

We took a drive so he could show me some quirks and things about the car, then he also kindly offered for me to drive it. Obviously I couldn't pass that up. First impressions sitting in the car.

1. The interior is incredibly nice. Even though it's for the minimalist, it feels very premium.

2. The acceleration is absolutely astonishing. That's really the only words I can come up with. When I was riding in the passenger seat, I could feel it in my gut how fast it was. Almost even got a little light headed cause I wasn't expecting it. 

3. The autopilot was surreal. I have a pilot background and i understand how it works, but you truly can't comprehend how it works so well in this car. Yeah it's not perfect and there are some weird things about it.  I was watching the radar of the cars going by and as well as the lines on the road, it does a very good job of keeping track, and it can only get better.

4. Passing other cars is an absolute breeze. Pulled up to a red light, mashed the gas, another driver pulled out two lanes just to get in front of me. I slowed down and observed where he was going, then went past him with ease. It's always nice when a car can give you that chuckling feeling.

Overall it seems like a fantastic car. I don't have a very long commute but anything to make it easier is a big deal. And being able to completely remove your hands from the wheel and pedals is a wild feeling. 

Thanks again Ted for the experience. I'll have to see if I can justify the cost.",teslamotors,1569975367,SteenosMT,0,1,True,2019-10-01

334,Underrated: v10 AP improvements on local non-divided roads,"As an owner of a MCU1, HW2.5 Model X, my biggest joy from v10 has been the improvements to AP behavior, especially outside of highways.

I didn‚Äôt get the fancy games and video streaming. Enhanced summon is still in parlor-trick category for me, it being a first beta release. But man, has AP been a huge improvement:

1. Car anticipates tight curves and slows down reliably where it didn‚Äôt use to. Some curves it did, but most I had to slow down myself. No longer an issue.

2. The pick up speed from stopped state is now human-like so I no longer have to cajole it with extra acceleration.

3. No more dancing car animations.

4. Better visualization of double yellow line and other vehicles. Feel more confident about what the car sees and doesn‚Äôt.

5. Much smoother and natural stop when approaching stopped traffic.

I still haven‚Äôt ever seen the red-light detection UI so not sure if it works in my config. Nor has it fixed incorrect reading/assumptions of speed limits in certain sections.

But all in all, very happy with AP and can‚Äôt wait to try it on highways and see how much NOAP has improved. It‚Äôs not FSD but a lot of my driving has shifted to AP even when running local errands. Great Job Tesla AP team! üëç üôè",teslamotors,1570025772,teahugger,55,153,True,2019-10-02

346,PSA: If you have a mildew smell coming from your AC when it first turns on...,"Having just paid $227 to fix what I consider a design flaw, let me tell you guys how to avoid this.

Apparently, if you use air recirculation along with cabin overheat AC protection, then the condensation that naturally builds up never really has a chance to evaporate especially if you live in a warm area where cabin overheat is on a lot.  This causes mildew to build up and cause this terrible smell like someone who just ran a marathon and took off their shoes in your car.

To avoid this *design flaw*, only use recirculation if you absolutely have to, and to be extra safe turn on fan only cabin overheat.

If you already have the smell, I had *some* success by opening all doors, turning on recirc and full blast the heat for an hour.  This will let all the water evaporate and kill at least some of the bacteria.


If that doesn‚Äôt work you can buy and replace filters but that will only work if the mildew isn‚Äôt also elsewhere.  You may need to pay Tesla $227 to spray some antibacterial foam and replace the filters 


Suggestion to Tesla: since we can‚Äôt just leave recirc on forever, maybe we can get a toggle switch to turn it on under certain conditions, like freeway only so we don‚Äôt have to breathe in smog as much",teslamotors,1570030355,vbpatel,188,140,True,2019-10-02

382,Uninformed folks and being a Tesla promoter,"My experiences with folks that don‚Äôt know Tesla

I got my Model 3 in June and since then I have been on a mission to show everyone in my circle how much better a Tesla is compared to pretty much anything out there (in the general price range). The main issue I have noticed is that most folks in my circle have a lot of misconceptions about the car and for whatever reason, they settle down for a regular ICE rather than giving Tesla a shot at test driving. 

General questions range from (I wonder if you guys hear the same things): 

But you have to charge it every night, right?

What happens if there is no power at home?

I have heard that battery is like an iPhone and will deteriorate in a year or two?

What does the big screen do? Just show you where you are going?

The auto pilot is a gimmick right? I mean does it really change lanes itself?

It has no vent controls?

Does it feel weird not having a screen in front of your steering?



During and after my quick demo, I get responses like - 

Feels a lot bigger inside than it looks from the outside!


It is insanely fast and I feel like I just got off a roller coaster. 

You can go 280+ miles without a charge in normal driving?

I have never seen tech like this anywhere!

The car updates itself? So, you get a newer car every few days?

Autopilot feels so natural and scary. 

My friend who is a Porsche fan and has 2 porches in the family test drove my car and admitted that this is faster than his Porsche Cayman and much more ‚Äútorquier‚Äù and he should probably just ‚Äúdowngrade‚Äù to this since it handles better than his Porsche because of its AWD. 

My brother in law who is an old school American muscle guy admitted he has never felt this much torque with control in any of the muscle cars he has sat in. 

All of them get blown away with stuff like the stereo and Netflix etc. 

I have converted two of my friends who are now in the order process and shown the power of Tesla to the others. 


I feel like I am a Tesla marketer now and has made it my personal goal to remove misconceptions about the car and the company.

Fine, Elon delivered Smart Summon as promised and it's ""neat"" although I don't have first hand experience with it even though I have v10 since Friday, but this has always been a waste of resources at Tesla when they should be focusing on highways and main routes to be 100% autonomous asap.  

This SS feature is nothing more than showmanship at this stage by Tesla that could cause property damage or worse, human injury or death.  I'm surprised it hasn't been deemed illegal yet it's so risky. If a pedestrian should be seriously injured or die, Tesla could take a serious hit in the wake of such an event.  Is that what we want?  

Elon Musk should know better not to risk everything that EVs and Machine Learning can do for us i the future, putting it all on the line.  Tesla's enemies would like nothing more than to use driver-less, passenger-less accidents with SS to doom the company and Musk.

If you want to Tesla to succeed stop using Smart Summon in parking lots filled with cars and pedestrians. You risk something you own worth tens of thousands of dollars on something that is not even very good at self-driving. You risk Tesla.

Full disclosure, I bought a fully loaded Tesla Model 3 with AP and FSD last year.  I use Autopilot responsibly as often as possible to help contribute to self driving data but I will not use SS due to the risk to myself financially, Tesla existence and the self driving technology in general.

417,Model 3 Charging Thud and Service Bulletin,"I was charging a Model 3 last winter on a 240v and heard a loud thud.  I have since then heard it many times in cold weather.   This has been posted many time in this sub \[1,2,3\], and each time the top comment is something along the lines of this being normal.

However, Tesla has a service bulletin that states, ""The 'thunk' noise occurs when the air pressure outside the battery is different than the air pressure inside battery"" and ""Upon customer complaint of a 'thunk' noise coming from the HV battery, replace the HV battery breathers with updated components that will help equalize the pressure inside the battery with the pressure outside, faster and quieter."" \[4\]

Now, I have no experience with service bulletins, but I don't understand how is this normal, as everyone says, including my service center, yet Tesla is saying there is a fix to mitigate it?  Has anyone used this service bulletin to get their service center to install the new HV battery breathers?

Someone posted this service bulletin a while back, but I couldn't find it in my searching.  All I found was people saying this was normal, which seems at odds with Tesla's service bulletin.  Common, sure.  Normal, why?

tl;dr: Thud sound from charging in the cold has a fix Tesla knows about.  Shouldn't this fix be deployed, and not just tell people that sound is ""normal""?

456,Project Idea: locally hosted video through Theater via Raspberry Pi,"Hi all, this is a project idea for someone capable of sniffing network traffic and web development. Streaming video will use a significant amount of data, and at 1080p that is maybe 3 GB/hour, and not everyone has unlimited data, etc. To me, it looks like YouTube in the Tesla is essentially running some YouTube web UI to play videos, since it sounds like you could click a link and even get to the Plex web UI.

So my proposal is to have a Raspberry Pi that functions as a wifi access point that the Tesla can connect to. It won't have actual internet access, so the RPi will run a webserver that when the Tesla YouTube app opens, the RPi will serve up a fake YouTube portal populated with your local videos. The local videos will need to be in a format that can be played on a web browser, so may or may not require re-encoding on your end. It doesn't have to be a pretty interface, either. Even a file list of local video files, and just click on one to play. Or you can put thumbnails/covers that can then be rendered with this fake YouTube server. Subtitles can also be added since I saw the YouTube app has the CC button. And if you need the actual internet again, just unplug/shut off the RPi and you are back online.

The benefit is you can watch high-quality video whether or not you have access to internet. On a distant camping trip, you are supposed to enjoy nature and being away from everything, but maybe uncontrollable kids need a little dose of distraction. Superchargers don't have wifi, and no hotspot, you can switch over to this to burn some time. My vehicle doesn't have convenient access to my home wifi so it would be difficult to do this. But this could be a good project for a high school student (good for college apps, props in the Tesla community) or college student (open-source Github project for your resume).

Another idea (if possible with RPi hardware) is the RPi can run the access point while also being connected to home wifi. So you can transfer video files to the RPi over home network, but the RPi will intercept the YouTube app launching to show its locally hosted files.

472,Mobile Charger Nema 10-30 adapter and dryer outlet issue,"Hello-

So I have my 10-30 outlet for dryer in Garage and I have been trying to charge with that. I initially ordered an adapter from TeslaÔøº as it does not come with NEMA 10-30. 

Every time I connect the mobile charger to adapter and plug it in, I keep getting this behavior where T character on Tesla mobile charger blinks 5 times and the resultant charging rate drops to 8 amp. 

I did some Google searching and people said this could be adapter issue. 

I went to Tesla to test this Adapter and they said everything is working fine. 

To eliminate the possibility of the outlet issue, I later asked my friend to test this out and he had the exact same behavior. 

Is this adapter issue? What can I do to eliminate the possibility of having bad adapter or bad outlet?

483,I'm about to get a lot of hate but it's all good. I just really want to know and I need to know because it's driving me crazy not knowing.,"I personally can't stand the charging stations at malls or even at some newer shopping centers. A whole lot of you think they're there to sit at for hours upon hours at a time to charge your car free of cost. Meanwhile, I own a car that costs about the same if not more than even the cheapest available Tesla. I don't own a Tesla because I travel, extensively and electric cars just aren't there yet.

Why do you people feel so entitled to literally steal a resource that someone else has to pay for just because you own an electric car? If it's so cheap to do as claimed then why don't you do that shit at home?

Why do you people even think these are a sustainable product to begin with? I'm not seeing the appeal with these tiny cars you guys own, at all. Fossil fuels are burned in order to produce the power needed to supply your car with power, which in turn puts a pretty big demand on power stations during the peak hours you people enjoy sucking power from. Do you have some sense of pride knowing that you think that you're not contributing to whatever it is that you're against? At least by your own hand? Because I'll tell ya, the exact opposite is true. You are continuing largely by putting power plants into situations during peak hours that they have to over supply to keep the flow of electricity to everyone using it.

I don't have anything to expensive or extravagant. I have a mid level SUV that comes out to the dealership with a 45k dollar price tag attached to it. Is it safe for me to assume that I should have some entitlement and just park at a fuel station and expect to get free fuel just because I own a vehicle?

These public charge stations aren't monitored, aren't regulated  and aren't pay by minute/hour/whatever. They're meant to be used while you shop. Not sit in your car for the full length of the time it takes to fully charge.

Try to help me understand here. I don't hate the cars specifically. They have a lot of cool features. It's just the arrogant and ignorant owners of these cars are really messing it up for the car and the entire image of the brand.",teslamotors,1570072764,reddit_loves_commies,67,0,True,2019-10-02

Am on Windows so can't Fat32 format natively.  Used GuiFormat.exe but it errored that drive was in use on default allocation unit size.  Spurious error because...

Found that it did work on much lower allocation unit sizes (though one halved the available size, too many blocks for *32 bit* addressing, hence fat32) but one worked and still gave me ~500GB.  

The car hated both formats.  Took forever then popped up that drive was unusable for TeslaCam.  

Struggled with it for a bit then thought maybe the actual problem was the partition table/type.  

Used diskpart to clean the drive (clean is the name of the sub-command, be very careful you have selected the correct disk first) and then disk manager to write an MBT table and create a volume (NTFS).  

Then GuiFormat.exe worked like a charm on default setting.  

And car recognized the drive perfectly.  

Also, this drive is nice because it has an LED (hard to see in sunlight though) so you can see if it's being accessed.  Also comes with both USB-A and USB-C cables, so maybe can use C to review footage in the field on my phone (haven't tried yet).

34,Tesla Body Shop in Santa Clara - 2 experiences,"Unfortunately my vehicle has been to the body shop twice. I thought I'd write a review of this shop for those in the Bay Area that are looking at places to get their car repaired.

Right off the bat, let me say that communication with the body shop is miserable. It's rare for them to answer their phone and e-mails can go days without response. The front desk people there are very nice and very helpful when you're in the shop, but it can be a black hole otherwise. My most recent repair, I actually had to walk in there to see what was going on with my car because calling/emailing was getting me nothing. Once the car is assessed, you get an estimator to communicate with and that tends to be 24 hours or less response time.
  
1st visit was April of 2019. Front end fender bender caused the vehicle to be in their shop for more than a month. The parts order process for them seems very lax. They weren't sure when they'd arrive from Tesla and would just check the weekly deliveries to see if my parts were on the truck. Once the parts arrived, the car went from disassembly, repair, reassembly, paint and QA rather quickly. Once I received the car, I had a green notice on the screen letting me know autopilot features were currently unavailable and may be available next time I start the car.  I had had the front rebuilt basically as well as windshield replaced so I figured it was re-calibrating and would fix itself. Then I noticed the thermostat wasn't working either. A few days later I took it to the Tesla Service Center in Sunnyvale where they discovered several cables not attached or loosely attached. This should've been caught at the QA area. A week or so later I also realized that the frunk hood was rubbing against the front of the car as the weather warmed up. More on that  in the next visit.
  
My 2nd visit was in August of 2019 and was more of a cosmetic repair caused by a hit and run. This time the car was in the shop 8 days before they were able to assess the damage and another 8 days to repair the damage. The rear bumper cover was replaced and side panels repaired / repainted. I mentioned the frunk rubbing and after some back and forth, agreed to adjust the frunk to stop the rubbing. 8 days later, the car was ready to come home. This time everything was in perfect working order and I'm 100% satisfied with the service.
  
As a bonus, they discovered some scratches on the front right side of my bumper (some floor tiles had fallen on it and scratched it up very badly). Those scratches are completely gone. They definitely went above and beyond there. 

So all in all, I'd definitely continue using them with the understanding of what to expect. Hopefully I'll never be back there again. People need to stay the heck away from my car....",teslamotors,1567289467,Wavern,7,16,True,2019-08-31

Along the way, my wife and I were talking about Supercharger etiquette/scenarios such as ""What happens if someone just leaves their car at a slot overnight (ie ones near hotels)""

That got me thinking, wouldn't it be nice if the Tesla app showed car names at the Supercharger station and allowed you to message other Tesla owners if the station was full or you wondered if anyone was nearly finished?

165,Transit Time,"
So, let me preface this by giving you some back story. I ordered a Model 3 back in early August, VIN assignment was taking forever, so I was actively looking at inventory cars (ordered a pearl white LR AWD) and found one that said it was at the Fremont Delivery Hub, so I‚Äôd be able to avoid transport fees. So placed a new order on that VIN, had my other order cancelled. Once I got my paperwork, my advisor and I soon found out that car was already in transit to Chicago. I live in DFW. After a few days of Tesla trying to redirect, they finally got the car on a truck, however, it hasn‚Äôt moved according to them. They looked up the load, and it was the only car on the load. So apparently, my car is sitting on the back of a truck, somewhere in the Chicago area. It was originally given an ETA of 9/3.... but now it just says unknown lol.

They are confident it will arrive DFW this week, technically speaking its only about 15-ish hours away driving, so a two-work-day drive, right? Wondering what other‚Äôs people‚Äôs feedback is on it. The only deadline I‚Äôm working to is my trade-in packet has a pay off date of 9/7.",teslamotors,1567375060,AstroMarco,1,2,True,2019-09-01

While saving confusion on the customers part in terms of what model to buy when new, the changes/improvements between say a 2017 and 2019 might not be as apparent. Which when buying second hand would be very valuable information.

Does a list with the changes made over time already exist? If not, I‚Äôd be interested in compiling one, a timeline showcasing the improvements/changes made to the Model 3 physically and software wise as a guide for people to use when picking a specific model to buy.

178,One year of owning a Model 3,"It was on this day last year that I took delivery of my pearl white, LR RW Tesla Model 3. 

I had stood in line two years previous to reserve the car, and was open to order it sometime around April of 2018. However, my wife and I hemmed and hawed over making the purchase, as we'd hoped to be able to pick up a more affordable version. We live in Ontario, and felt we could only truly afford even a shorter range version because of a provincial rebate for $14,000. 

By the time April of last year rolled around, it seemed clear that the rebate was going to go away, because of a provincial election, in which the conservative party - who'd promised to eliminate the rebate - was likely to win.

We decided to go ahead with our purchase in June, completing our order, but only after the incoming government promised to honour the rebate to people who ordered the car before they took power. Then, about two weeks after we ordered it, the government cancelled the rebate without warning, leaving us in limbo as we *definitely* didn't feel that we could afford the car without the rebate (it had a base price of $65,000 and came to $74,000 Canadian with tax). 

While they cancelled the rebate, they allowed *all* EVs ordered by companies with dealerships in Ontario a grace period that extended to September 14th. For any EV manufactured by Chevy, Nissan, and all the others, owners with cars delivered by the 14th of September would be eligible to receive the rebate. Because Tesla didn't have a dealership model, they were excluded. However, in Ontario their stores *were* registered as dealerships, which put the PC Party's argument on very shaky ground.

I then spent a huge chunk of the summer trying to contact the government, reaching out to my own local representative, getting in touch with the provincial Ombudsman, talking to the media here in Toronto about it, and debating on Twitter literally anyone and everyone who supported the revocation of the rebate without the Conservatives honouring their pledge to allow all previous orders to receive the promised $14,000. 

I eventually caught the notice of Dan Kim, who was then a Tesla exec. He put me in touch with a lawyer at Tesla, who I then aided in gathering contacts and information as Tesla decided to move forward and sue the government.

There was a lot of which to be afraid. While the rebate was in limbo, my wife and I had to decide if we needed to cancel our order. Tesla was gracious enough to offer a full refund of all deposits, but I believed we might be able to get the government to reverse course. However, if the car was built and delivered before they changed their mind, then we ran the risk of potentially having to buy the car for a full price we couldn't afford. And if the car was built and delivered after September 14th (the aforementioned final day of rebate eligibility), then we would no longer be eligible, even if the government changed its mind, or was forced to comply.

It was announced on August 27th that Tesla won the lawsuit, which was delivered in a scathing summary written by the presiding justice. That meant they only had two weeks to build and deliver our order before we'd still end up missing the window. 

As soon as the verdict was made, I emailed Dan Kim asking if our car was being built. Later that day, I was given a call and informed that our car was on a train for Toronto. Only five days later, it arrived.

(An interesting side note - the PC government later lost a separate suit, and in that instance, the Premier chose to use a provincial privilege of rejecting the judge's verdict, temporarily for a total of five years, at which point the verdict would go into effect. Doug Ford could have used it in the case of the Tesla suit as well. I wonder if he considered it at the time?)

Anyway - I was going to actually write a review of my experience of actually owning the car, but it turned into this instead. If there's interest, maybe in the comments below I will actually share my experiences.

180,My Model 3 REALLY impressed me tonight,"I was driving home after shopping this evening with my fiance. It's dark out and raining, so visibility is pretty poor. The cool rain was falling on to hot asphalt so there was some steam coming up from the roadways as well to make things all the better.

We were driving down a country road going about 45 MPH with TACC enabled but not AutoSteer. Out of nowhere, my Model 3 starts to brake pretty hard and I'm thinking oh, how nice, another instance of phantom braking. Normally I step on the gas during these events to get my car back up to speed but I didn't this time and I'm glad I didn't. 

It turns out a person in dark clothing on a bicycle with no lights on was traveling in the same direction as we were on the right-hand side of the road. I couldn't see him until I was right up on him.

My Model 3 saw him well enough in advance to start braking so I could safely pass him at a reasonable speed. I was SHOCKED the car even spotted him. It was dark, moderately raining, foggy from the roadways, and he was off to the side of the road, and through it all, it saw him and started braking. 

The vision system may not be perfect yet, but tonight I'm more thrilled with my car than usual. Just thought I would share.",teslamotors,1567385391,idealdreams,61,396,True,2019-09-01

Looking for advice from those that have installed their own NEMA 14-50 receptacles. I‚Äôm going to be completely honest, I think it‚Äôs a crock that electricians are charging upwards of $750 for a plug installation in my garage when the breaker box is also located in the garage.

With that being said I‚Äôm looking to install my own because I‚Äôm confidant in my abilities to do it. Furthermore I have all the proper tools and a lot of time to do it without making any mistakes.

However I am looking for any tips/tricks from anyone on here who has done their own installation. I‚Äôm lucky to have my breaker box in the garage which should pose a lot less problems, however it‚Äôs only 100amps service which could be an issue with the 50 amp breaker.

261,Model 3 Performance vs. LR AWD Performance,"So I was in the same boat as many of you looking to get a Model 3. I was torn between getting the LR AWD and the Performance. After much thinking on it and reading posts here, I have decided to get the Performance. My wall charger has already arrived and the electrician is already working on getting parts to get enough power in the garage for it!

However, I keep seeing on the forums about unbundling the Performance Upgrade Package with the Performance model. So it sounds like I would be able to get the Performance model with the 18 inch wheels, non performance brakes, no spoiler, etc. This seems to cause the car to be about 10% more efficient because of the 18 inch vs 20 inch wheels. I have a few questions about this:

1. Is this configuration still available if you go through someone in Tesla Sales? It sounds like this was the ""Stealth"" package which isn't available anymore.
2. How much does doing this actually save in price of the car (assuming it is still available)?
3. Does this cause the 0-60 time to be the same, or do I lose a few tenth's of a second because of the smaller wheels?

So I called Tesla and they confirmed it, however it reduces the range 20 miles while doing it.

282,Insurance rates by trim level (model 3),"Hi, reddit. I've been researching model 3s for some time now. One lingering question I have is, ""Do insurance rates on my vehicle vary depending on the trim level I pick?"" The obvious answer would presumably be, ""Of course they do,"" but on some insurers' websites, for Tesla vehicles I see only the make is selectable which is odd considering the voluminous trim options for other manufacturers'.

\&gt;\_&gt; As a misc. note, the best quote I've found for a model 3 is around \~$130 a month under GEICO. I'm a male in my early 30s living in the northeastern United States in a fairly decent neighborhood who drives maybe 6k miles a year, mostly commute.

310,"Tried auto park today, wasn't impressed.","I had two expectations. That it would be between the lines, and it wouldn't drive into anything. I've always wanted to try it, and I saw the auto park button for the first time.  Well, I clicked it. It backed up without a sharp enough turn and was crooked from the start. The car was just stopped for a good 10 seconds (which felt like eternity when there was a car waiting because I'm half way into the road), and then my car finally drove forward to straighten out. 

I wasn't very disappointed now, I didn't care that it was taking time, as long as it parked correctly. But then it started backing up, and as it got to the back, the car stopped. It was crooked. So much that the front of the car was slightly over the right line, and the back touching the left line. 

I rate that 2 out of 5 stars. But then the parking spot on the screen flipped sideways, and then my car out of nowhere moved backwards and the back wheel hit the curb and I hit the brakes and it said auto park aborted. 

0/5 stars. A short time after this I hit the dashcam button. I'm still learning how to use these features, as I've only had FSD for a couple weeks and the car for around a month, so I'll see if it caught the video when I check the flash drive.",teslamotors,1567480531,fflip8,35,11,True,2019-09-02

I have a problem, and I hope someone here can help me with my issue.

I would like to take a test drive with a Model 3, so I went to their website and filled the form. The answer was ""You will be notified when there is a slot free for a test ride in your region"". The problem is that I live in Dresden, Germany. And there is no Tesla store anyway close by. I would have to go all the way to Berlin to do this, which is something that I am ok with, but I am quite sure the system will not tell me when there is a slot in Berlin, if he knows I live in Dresden.

I tried calling the stores in Berlin but, to my surprise, all I get is a machine message walking me through the different sections of the website! No chance to talk to any human being at all. Once the message is over, it hangs on me.

How could I solve my issue? How could I make it known to Tesla that I would like to get a test ride IN BERLIN, even though I do not live close by?

I'm a HUGE Tesla fan, and I got my first chance to get a first hand look at the Model S, 3, and X yesterday in the showroom located in The Domain in Austin Texas.

I just feel indifferent right now, cause seeing the Teslas made my day, but losing those sunglasses (which means a lot to me) got me pretty sad.

I called the showroom, but they didn't find anything.

It's my understanding that the battery pack is in the cab portion of the vehicle and that the range is 500-600 miles. That's great for short hops, but not sustainable for long-haul drivers. 

My idea, why don't they build the trailer portion also? Instead of building a traditional trailer, make the floor or a sub-floor all battery. Granted batteries of that size would take a while to charge up, but that should be fine. Charge the trailers while they are sitting in the loading bays of warehouses and they should be good to go for their next trip.

Current trailers could be retrofitted with batteries or they could be left for the daily, short-haul trip. 

Obviously the cab would still have it's own battery pack, but hooking up the trailer could give the whole setup an additional immense range for long-haul.",teslamotors,1567534393,smartass505,12,0,True,2019-09-03

385,Tesla should offer a 'gas guzzler' credit ... a spin off on the 'gas guzzler' tax.,"First, this isn't meant to come off as some 'Tesla sales are plateauing' post. It's just a general/fun idea.

The concept is pretty simple - Offer a small, but meaningful, credit for those who trade in a car, truck or SUV of 'X' age which falls below 'Y' fuel economy. Sort of, in a sense, a spin on paying a gas guzzler tax. Like a gas guzzler tax reimbursement. 

Outside of wanting to reduce your footprint, or wanting a Tesla in general, there is no real incentive/urgency to purchase one while gas prices remain so low. It's a big part of the reason why high horsepower sedans, big SUV's, and trucks are so heavily desired right now here in the US. It's also why people who drive older, but not paid off, gas sucking vehicles who no longer need them, hold off on moving into something new... The ""I don't need this big SUV, but it's nice to have the space and the cost to fill it isn't killing me"".

I think this idea would be an interesting one to test out. I'm not talking some $10k+ trade incentive, but even something small but somewhat meaningful. 

Yes, it would cut into the bottom line slightly, but it would also only help to sell more cars while driving home the mission statement.",teslamotors,1567544804,TheTimeIsChow,6,0,True,2019-09-03

1) Video shows the model 3, LR, AWD, FSD, Ver 2019.32  following the Infinity just fine, action starts around the 27 sec mark and ends around the 40 sec mark, light ahead begins changing, Lexus slows, but autopilot not responding, hmmm, ok I‚Äôll let it go, sometimes it picks it up late and brakes harder than it should, Ok, it is now well into my uncomfortable zone and is slowing but definitely not fast or hard enough.  I finally intervene and start braking, which felt funny too when I engaged it.  Never experienced this before.  Footage doesn‚Äôt appear that drastic, but it was‚Ä¶

2) NOA on interstate, no video save, tried to take the exit long before the exit even started.   Nooo, that will put me into the barrier, intervened and went 1/4mi further where the exit lane actually started.  I had taken the exit before with no problems.  Could be the software ver 19.32  has a map update in it which is incorrect for that exit.  When I arrived at the Supercharger I immediately started cleaning off the sensors in event bug splatter was an issue.

Rest of trip was uneventful, except the very twisty mountains where it had a couple problems with tight curves, speed was the issue, it nailed 98% of them.  Pretty cool on most it slowed down from posted speed going into them or shortly after entering them.

1. Is it possible to upgrade to premium connectivity? I got a stock SR+ and it comes with the basic connectivity. I've been reading online that it was available at the start of July, but I can't see it anywhere inside the car's navigation menu at all. It's fairly annoying not knowing that traffic is coming up suddenly -- it's already caught me off-guard today.

2. Is it possible to make the Autopilot more defensive? I've been playing around with the settings and I've made it so I follow the car in front of me with a 5 second (I think the unit is seconds, at least) gap. However, the car *really* likes to center itself in the lane, and when there's a massive semi truck hugging the edge of the lane it's... a bit unnerving. Especially since it has a tendency to just kind of ""hang out"" right next to their blind spots. I get the feeling I've already done as much as I can in this regard, but if there's something I've missed I'm all ears.

3. Are there any accessories that you guys just can't live without? I haven't bought anything yet (not even floor mats), but I'm hoping to do so soon.

451,Update: Thinking About Selling 10 Day Old Model 3 AWD for Performance,"So wanted to provide an update post if anyone cared.  
So Tesla provided 45.5K for a trade in quote for my now (two weeks? 2 1/2 weeks) old Model 3 AWD. I haven't taken it to CarMax as I read that 1. for tesla's, they offer a lower price and 2. I don't want someone sitting in my car and joy riding for the one hour it takes to get an appraisal.

I have a pending Appraisal from Carvana who are known to offer higher than CarMax so cross my fingers there.  
I have a buyer on Carguru at 47K but that would require me to do a pay off first, wait for 10 days for the title to come and then do the transaction.  
Carvana would be option one as they take care of the lein stuff right off the back.

I **finally** took a test drive in a Performance yesterday and it was a......experience. It didn't really sway me and further in one direction tbh. The speed was definitely noticable, what people said was right, it really really hauls as. One thing I did notice was, at some points during the test, I started thinking to myself ""this is really dangerous."" Like that speed is absolutely bonkers. The front nose of the car actually pushes upwards when you floor it.

Also, people are asking why I don't save money and just buy the P3D-. I don't want to buy the same car with just faster acceleration. If I end up buying a brand new car after buying a car two weeks ago, I rather go for the full suite, spoiler, brakes, etc. 

I found myself thinking about maybe taking Tesla's offer cause they're the easiest to work with. I've been trying to convince myself that I can claim the $3000 state incentive, the $1875 tax credit and THEN i can claim another $3000 state incentive (according to the EV rep, they said I would have to get it co-signed as they wouldn't issue another EV credit to the same person) and another $1875 which would overall minimize the hit but at the end of the day, its just so much work.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Bought a Model 3 AWD two weeks ago, kinda regret not buying a P, test drove the P yesterday, didn't sway me any more to one direction, back to sqaure one.",teslamotors,1567598674,eatcabbage,4,0,True,2019-09-04

468,An unpopular opinion.,"I've been looking at and test driving cars with the intent on purchasing a vehicle soon this has involved an  extremely in-depth process for the past 6 months. If I've learnt anything it's that Tesla (and any other manufacturer like them) doesn't have a good sales/after sales strategy and they simply will not last long in Europe.

Take the new Porsche Taycan, it's give or take $150,000, the top of the range Tesla is $119,000, they're both closely matched considering what's available on the market as today. 

What do you get for the extra money? Well apart from better interior quality (sorry Tesla) you get a car that can be serviced more widely across a huge range of dealers, you'll get quick support/repairs and most importantly 3rd party repairs. This is fundamental for the majority of car buyers as they want flexibility and the ability to have there own vehicles back on the road asap, something that Tesla certainly does not offer in Europe. The car as a whole is arguably better but that's not what were discussing today.

So what does the Tesla offer to make up for this? As I'm sure you all know it's the amazing autopilot system... That's for the most part illegal in Europe and therefore the Tesla has the same level of autonomy as the Porsche currently has. 

I love Tesla, the design, the idea, the futuristic interior, but I simply could not see myself buying such an expensive car with no reassurance of being able to tow the car to a nearby dealer (or a 3rd party!) with the expectation of repair within a week. 

With the upcoming release/reveal of VW's ID3 coming next week along with the insane amount of competitively priced electric vehicles due in the next 2-3 years, Tesla are going to find it very hard to get a grip on the market unless something is done very quickly. Although they may have revolutionised the electric car market they now face being quicky left behind unless they can offer the same service as a company as huge as VW.",teslamotors,1567609207,Chemicalzz,139,0,True,2019-09-04
472,Android 10: Not being promoted for login/fingerprint,"So I upgraded to Android 10 yesterday and Tesla app is no longer printing me for fingerprint or password. confirmed that fingerprint is enabled and I even signed out and signed back in. Running version 3.9.1. 

Can't confirm if this bug was there before upgrade or not but it used to prompt for a fingerprint earlier, not sure which version broke it.

488,Beware of EVTV.me and Jack Rickard,"I'm posting this here because I hope that no other Tesla owners will have to deal with this.

[EVTV.me](https://EVTV.me) has a store where they sell parts for Teslas, including a CAN Bus monitor and OBD adapter. Their adapter contains some ""brains"" based on an ESP32 that provides it's own hotspot and allows for datalogging, etc.

I contacted them because I was looking to buy just the harness, without the brains and box. This is something they don't have on their website, but considering they already have the parts, it would be easy and inexpensive to assemble and sell.

When emailing them asking if they could sell something like that, the conversation turned into quite the troll fest, I really was shocked to see such unprofessional replies from someone attempting to do business with the public. Truthfully, my last reply wasn't the most professional either. 

Turns out I'll source the connectors myself, as they weren't any help, and I recommend that anybody considering buying parts from [evtv.me](https://evtv.me) considers who they are giving money to before buying.

Also, it's quite an entertaining conversation if you enjoy this kind of nonsense.

489,January 2018 Crash,"I've been seeing alot of news surrounding the January 2018 crash as it has now been revealed the the car was on Autopilot during the crash. There has been alot of talk blaming Tesla for not making Autopilot restrictive enough and that they ""allowed"" the driver to be hands free. Just want to give my input and see what others think.

https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20849499/tesla-autopilot-crash-culver-city-2018-ntsb-report

Here is my 2 cents. The lead car changed lanes and left the Model S driving into a stationary fire truck. Along with a Model S, I also drive a KIA Optima with adaptive cruise control and it would do the EXACT SAME THING. That is just how radar works, it can't see that stuff that quick. I've had it almost happen before except I'm not an idiot and actually pay attention. It is so annoying that people STILL blame Tesla for drivers misusing car technology. If someone accelerated into something you wouldn't blame the car manufacturer for making the car fast. And about ""Autopilot"" being a bad name; if you are going to comment on that then you should have some background on what actual airplane Autopilot does. Spoiler alert: it does even less. If a plane is heading right into you, airplane Autopilot won't do ANYTHING. The name is absolutely appropriate and the Tesla system is more advanced than the name should imply.

493,Roadshow article about outage is ridiculously misleading," [https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-app-down-outage-key/#](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-app-down-outage-key/#) 

So this author apparently didn't do enough research to know that the Model 3 is the only car with a Key Card, or that the Bluetooth Phone Key even exists for the 3, and can work without an internet connection.

I don't know about any of you guys, but I own a 3 and was never locked out or even had to pull out my card.  The only reason I even noticed the outage is because I couldn't connect to the car to remotely turn on the Climate control.

I used to have a lot of respect for CNET, so its pretty disappointing that they would let someone write an article about Tesla who obviously has no clue what he's talking about.",teslamotors,1567627397,zipdiss,1,2,True,2019-09-04
495,Upgrading from Standard to Standard Range +,"I ordered and currently drive a Standard Range Model 3 and was wondering if anyone‚Äôs actually upgraded to SR+. Who did you call, did you just pay the difference; also where/how did you pay, and did it take a while for the changes to be pushed?  
  
 I notice I cap at 100kWh when supercharging (no confirmation this is a SR only limit), no fog lights and I don‚Äôt have immersive sound. Still have the back rear heated seats tho. I do enjoy being able to charge to 100% on road trips knowing it‚Äôs really only ~92% tho. I can continue to live without the upgrades, just wanted to know so if I have some extra money one day I can be prepared. For anyone wondering why I didn‚Äôt just get the SR+, it saved me $1,590 before the $1,000 price drop mid July.",teslamotors,1567630044,downwindfortreetree,32,30,True,2019-09-04
