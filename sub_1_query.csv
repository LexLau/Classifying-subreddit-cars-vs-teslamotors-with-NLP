1,Considerations when charging at a v3 charger?,"So a brand new v3 charger went in nearby, which will be super convenient for me. I’ve stopped by a few times just to see if I can hit the 250 kW max (just to say I’ve seen it) and I never get anywhere close. I think the fastest I’ve seen it was around 90 kW. It’s never full here (not yet, anyways) and I usually have a pretty low charge when I come by. It’s been cool but not cold and on several occasions my battery has been preconditioned.

Any thoughts on why I might not be getting faster charge rates?",teslamotors,1577559649,Thegeobeard,46,1,True,2019-12-28
2,2020 Tesla Roadster - New feature I haven't seen being discussed here,"Hello,

I appear to have found my way to the front page of the internet via the back door apparently as I only just joined...

Quick preamble: Recently, I've been closely watching the 2020 Tesla Roadster deliberately, in hopes that doing so will help facilitate purchasing one in some way or another.  Anyhow, so what I've been doing is daily 'Past 24hr' google searches for new things regarding this car and a couple of days ago now there was a french article which seemed like a report from some kind of auto show where the car was on display recently and the writer had made some bullet point lists of features they'd apparently seen the car to offer.

So the reason for my post here was that I came to the front page of the internet to see if you guys were aware of this yet. I've seen plenty of discussion around the web about the model 3's offset screen and hopes for a projected heads-up display and yeah that's what this french article said the roadster was going to have... Pretty awesome if that's the case!

  
P.S I had a look around for that french article again and while I didn't look too hard, I couldn't find it. Sorry...",teslamotors,1577559740,Phantasm22,0,1,True,2019-12-28
4,Expected depreciation,"I'm looking at buying a model 3 in the UK in about a year's time. I looked at the used market and it seems that even models that have a few thousand miles on them are selling for the same price as new. Presumably this is because they've only been in the UK for a few months, and as the market settles the used prices will start to come down. 

I'm not really interested in paying the new price for a 3, but if the used market is asking the same (ish) price as the new car then I'd just get a new one. 

My question is: what's the expected depreciation after 12-18 months? What do 12-18 month old model 3's sell for in the US etc, relative to new?",teslamotors,1577559979,AcesFullOfKings,12,1,True,2019-12-28

Followed the directions, and the inflator turned on for a moment and stopped. Never to turn on again. Glad it wasn’t an emergency and I desperately needed it!

13,I need help convincing my parents and friends Tesla is the best car choice for me.,"Hello everyone. 

I am looking to buy a new Model 3 early next year, but I can’t seem to get my parents and close friends to understand why it’s a smart choice. 

I am a 23 year old male living by myself and making my own decisions, so of course I don’t need their permission, but I want them to understand my choice and support it. 

I am working full-time with sales and doing it very well at the moment, so the price and loan payments are not the main issue. 

I live in Norway which has a lot of government incentives to buy electric cars, and going electric is definitely a smart choice for the area where I live and my usage and needs for a car. 

Ever since the unveil, the Model 3  has been my dream car, and I haven’t been able to stop talking about it since. 

Now why do my parents and friends disagree with my choice? 

1. They think it’s stupid to buy a new car instead of something used since I’m only 23 and don’t own an apartment yet. 

2. They are worried about the big loan and the fact that it’s over 10 years. Maybe it will be more difficult to get a loan for an apartment in a few years. 

2. They want me to buy one of the other popular electric cars like the Nissan Leaf or Hyundai Ioniq which I can buy used and costs way less, while I still benefit from the government incentives. 

My arguments to them has been that Tesla has a LOT more range in their cars, and since I will be using it a lot for work that’s absolutely crucial to me. 
I have the ability to charge at the Supercharger network which is super fast and convenient. 
The  technology and over-the-air updates is a big factor for me. I am a tech enthusiast and love the approach Tesla has to software. 
Of course the cars design and specs too. 

I have test driven the car twice at my local dealership and fell even more in love with it. 

My family and friends look at cars as a way of transportation, but for me it’s more about the feeling I get from driving my dream car :’) 


Feel free to ask any questions. 
I am looking forward to hearing your guys’ opinion on this.",teslamotors,1577564924,Chillroy,12,1,True,2019-12-28

47,Bad news for orders still waiting for a VIN.,"Unfortunately, I just got off the phone with a Tesla representative, who was extremely apologetic, informing me that they will not be able to deliver my Model 3 before the end of the year.

As it stands I now have an projected delivery of second week of January.

I have several friends and colleagues that placed orders after me and took delivery earlier this month, so I pressed the representative on why my order was being delayed. Unfortunately, the rep was not able to answer my questions aside from citing general production issues, but did inform me that upper management (whomever that may entail) will be convening on Monday to formulate a way to compensate customers. If anyone placed their order in-person at a Tesla store, the local reps have also been notified and I was told they should contact anyone affected soon.

57,CyberTruck Feature Requests,"Here are a few CyberTruck feature requests:

* Integration with Tesla Powerwall Gateway to adjust charging amps if grid goes down or to supply power safely to the home from the truck in addition to any Powerwalls (Powerwall gateway required for resynchronization with the grid’s frequency when it comes back online unless you like exploding CyberTrucks)
* Tow hooks unless mobile service or roadside assistance will go anywhere and everywhere in remote areas
* Winch capable to pull it out of sticky situations
* Roll down back window for ventilating the vault when closed and for passengers accessing the cooler, etc. while driving
* Yellowstone super volcano air filtration (better than bio weapon defense).  The cyber truck is the ideal vehicle for driving through volcanic ash as there are few moving parts exposed to air and stopping does not require brakes. To prevent the cabin filter from clogging recirculate the interior air and close the air intake on the battery cooling system. Limit power as needed to keep battery within acceptable temps.  https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanic_ash/vehicles.html
* Rear seatback entertainment screens or allow on-screen entertainment to stream to locally connected Tesla apps.
* HDMI input
* High power USB-C data outlets in addition to normal USB data plugs
* USB outlet in glovebox for Sentry mode clips
* Auto open/close front doors on tri-motor
* Drain valve on waterproof frunk
* Adjust all powered seats from screen
* Siri/Google Assistant support for most Tesla voice commands recently introduced.  At least allow authorized people to make voice requests from their phones. 
* Intercom functionality with exterior speaker
* Play sports streams/music through exterior speaker
* Removable tailgate
* Integrated trailer brake controller
* Multiple wireless magnetic trailer cameras to make up for lack of large trailering mirrors on sides and can replace/augment the stream for the rear view mirror
* 5th wheel attachment capable
* Full size spare
* Central tire inflation system

59,Thoughts on updated Model S,"I keep reading a lot about the comment about the Model S being only made for sentimental reasons and it got me wondering, why? The Model 3 is not some all encompassing design, in so that they can't target an upper market, like the Mercedes S Class. The Model S, if redesigned right, has the possibility of being a complete game-changer if they can provide the following:

- Roadster 2 inspired front fascia (there are mock-ups, but hard to find). It would revamp the image, create buzz and demand.

- Premium seats and interior, similar to an S class in quality and pop - but refined like a Tesla. This would include higher customization options for customers, and a large 4k OLED touchscreen console (making this a showcase of the car).

- Insane range and performance, truly differentiating itself from the 3, I'm talking 450+ miles with 140+ kwh battery options, and nuburgring performance kit. Tri - motor option, dual standard.

I think if we can see that in the next 2 years, they could easily charge $115k + and go back to selling a ton of them, for an extremely high margin. It just makes sense to have it as kind of a halo car in a sense, but really just as a luxury version of what they're already offering. I think Tesla showcasing their tech in a car like this would help the imagery too, and scare the shit out of the ICE cars who will be maybe on par with the 2012 model s at that point.",teslamotors,1577591088,milehigh89,14,1,True,2019-12-28
63,Has anyone thought about a feature for autopilot that allows the driver to tell the car to hug closer to the left or right lane divider?,"I often find myself a little nervous when my car is in the very center of the carpool lane and there’s one of those concrete blocks practically on top of the left side lane divider. It feels like I’m a bit too close to the left side even though I’m in the middle of the “lane”. Or driving on one lane highways, the car feels too close to the left lane as well. I would think most human drivers would hug the right lane divider a bit more than being perfectly centered on these roads. 

I think it would be really nice to be able to tell autopilot to hug the left or right lane just a tiny bit depending on the situation. This could also help the machine learning for FSD when on these roads by aggregating the data drivers feel most comfortable with in specific lanes on highways for a more “humanlike FSD experience”

64,For those of you with Spotify loading issues...,"...I *may* have a workaround for a specific use-case that I'd love others to test if you're able!

I was having the typical issues of a single song playing then looping, or playlists refusing to advance to the next song automatically.  A Two Scroll Wheel Salute™ would fix it.

I narrowed down what was causing it to a [Raspotify](https://github.com/dtcooper/raspotify) setup I have in the house.  I use Spotify Connect to stream music from it, and the minute I'd do that, if I got in my 3 and drove off, the same loading issues would start all over again.

So, I started to narrow variables down from there, and I *may* have found what was causing it in my case.

Early on after the US release of Spotify, folks sniffed around and found that Spotify was streaming to the cars at 96kbps.  On my Raspotify setup I was streaming at 160kbps.

So I went in and lowered the streaming quality on Raspotify to 96kbps, and all my loading issues *seem* to have be resolved.  I can't get to it fail like I could prior to the change, no matter what I try.

**TL;DR** - If you use Spotify Connect devices, lower the streaming quality to Normal/96kbps, (if you're able to), and see if your loading issues are solved.

Particularly if you're carrying stuff or children while approaching car.

96,Planning roadtrip across europe. Feasible?,"Hi Tesla-trekkers,

I'm planning a trip with the kids from Denmark to the Algarve in southern Portugal.  On the way home I would be setting off on Easter Sunday. 

The plan is to use airbnb to stop underway.  I'm not a fan of driving all day, and have a 70D with 1.x autopilot hardware - haven't invested in autopilot yet.

- Is it feasible?
- How long might it take - how many days travel should I allow, assuming I allow time to relax and sightsee a little along the way.
- Any planning advice, thoughts on Airbnb, traffic in southwest europe, Easter traffic.
- I'm probably not up for camping alone with the kids, so any tips for finding healthy food along the way, ""glamping"" or similar ideas are welcome.",teslamotors,1577617458,danskal,26,1,True,2019-12-29

104,&lt;=HW2.5 and Voice Commands,"2018 Model 3, LR, AWD, FSD

I’m noticing the if I am at home on wifi the voice commands seem to work pretty well.  However when I’m out and about and on the Tesla network connection it’s pretty hit or miss, or none at all on the voice commands.  Has anyone postulated voice commands and level of response could also be hardware related and not just all network related?  

Reason I bring it up is, dictation and respond to text message does not work at all, even when I’m on WiFi.  The text will come in, if I press the scroll it reads it fine, but if I press the scroll wheel, nothing, holding it for extended period of time or just press and release has absolutely no response from the system.  The Microphone screen does not come at all.  It’s like the scroll wheel is dead, even though when pressed it played the incoming message.  So could it be a combination of Network and hardware?

By now everyone has pretty much hammered the voice commands across the fleet and I’d suspect similarities should be occurring.  So I put to the esteemed community if it could also be hardware related on the full functionality of the voice commands.  If so, that would cut down on the Voice command postings seeing the community believes its hardware and software….",teslamotors,1577623689,GoTesla,28,1,True,2019-12-29

107,I still don't think Legacy Auto Industry is taking EVs seriously,"VW recently announced that they are accelerating plans for EVs - targeting 1.5 million vehicles by 2025. Elon Musk, on the other hand, said in the Ark Invest podcast that by around 2024/2025 Tesla will be building 3 million vehicles. 

Tesla's technology is accelerating (for eg: their range and performance) and is likely to further because of their new batteries. 

Meanwhile, VW - which is so-called ""doing the most"" to accelerate EVs isn't likely to produce EVs at a profit, or *Tesla-comparable-range vehicles*. I think the German industry still seems to be only doing EVs to avoid environment penalty. 

I think they're hoping that a right wing consensus would be created by 2025 to roll back environment policies.

108,"I test drove a USD$207,000 Taycan Turbo S: Nice car but Tesla shareholders shouldn't be worried!","I got to drive one of these at a local Porsche dealer. It reminded me of a Ludicrous S in speed. It felt very flat and stable and had great handling and steering. The interior was very high quality and I liked the controls and touch screens. I liked the ability for rear seat occupants to control HVAC and seat heaters. The storage space in the front and rear trunks was much smaller than a Tesla's. The charging ports are in the front which I feel is a better location than in the rear. There is a control on the wheel similar to a Ferrari Manettino to control the drive modes of range-normal-sport and sport plus. Every time I went from one mode back to normal it turned on fake performance sounds which I could to disable. That reminded me of the ""creep"" feature on Tesla: the first thing to disable. The Taycan's $5,800 optional premium sound system did sound great. I went through about 12 miles of range on the car driving it fast and hard. I think I drove about 10-12 miles but we all know how low the range is and how inefficient the car is.

117,I declined my Model S delivery - at least I thought I did.,"TL, DR:  Ordered new inventory model S, on delivery date car had undisclosed damage. Tesla declined to fix, I declined the vehicle. Plot twist: have a new delivery appointment for same car. Fixed? unknown. 

Longer Version with photos &amp; timeline:

I placed an order for a Model S from the ""new inventory"" section of the tesla website.  I was hoping for delivery before end of year for the tax credit.
My ideal configured system and what was available in inventory was slightly different but close enough that I was ok with the higher price.

Configured in inventory:

* Model S Long Range
* Midnight Silver Metallic
* 21"" Sonic Carbon Twin Turbine Wheels ( I didn't really need these wheels, 19"" would have been fine)  
* All Black Premium Interior with Figured Ash Wood Décor
* Autopilot
* Full Self-Driving Capability
* Free Unlimited Supercharging

Order placed 12/14.  Car in transit between Walnut Creek, CA and Fremont, CA ( &lt;50 miles).   Estimated Delivery Date: 12/21


Contact from the delivery center on Friday 12/20 - car being updated and inspected.  Will be ready on 12/23.

Not ideal but I like the idea of any updates, readiness inspection and would rather it be ready rather than rushed. 

Delivery day: 

Fremont hub is hopping at 10am - people coming and going, not crowded, just busy.

Check in is a breeze, lobby is nice and we are met by our (I forget the official title) delivery person.  He was nice and started our paper work, confirmed all the details and took out out to see the car.

* Car is backed into spot and a curb scrape is visible on the driver side lower apron.  This is a cosmetic issue but given the nature of the front bumper, sensors and electronics is likely an expensive repaint.  [PIC 1](https://i.imgur.com/KjEGTly.jpg).  Photo isn't great of the white spot showing through the paint but does show the crease in the bumper(?) apron(?) 

At this point I decide we need to inspect the car more fully.

Further damage:

* Opening the trunk - the cargo cover has a liquid stain [PIC 2](https://i.imgur.com/3dobzXo.jpg)

* Driver side rear wheel has curb rash in a few places  [Full wheel](https://i.imgur.com/sokcbUf.jpg) and details:  [Scrub 1](https://i.imgur.com/4eTKdIG.jpg), [Scrub 2](https://i.imgur.com/uI4m8Jb.jpg), [Scrub 3](https://i.imgur.com/GrjWEWC.jpg)

Nothing else seems wrong with the car so we ask the delivery person to help us understand the options.  He's a volunteer so he didn't know the process here and brought us back inside to speak with some other people.

We are told that inventory cars are 'as-is' and all damage is disclosed in the vehicle description.  This is not my experience with this vehicle - there were no specific photos of this car, none of the damage I noted and nothing on the VPA describes the car as ""as-is"".

At this point we are told that our options are to accept the car or decline the car.  After a bit of back and forth,  our proposal**  with what we felt was a reasonable resolution was declined so we declined the car with the understanding that the $100 deposit is forfeit.   Later that day the car disappeared from the Tesla app on my phone - but my order is still active online...

** Proposed they (1)  fix or replace the wheel (they stated this was a cheap $250 repair any wheel shop in SJ could do); (2)  replace the cargo cover (they said this was a  item we could just buy to replace but didn't detail the price, I'll assume $200) and (3) cosmetic touch up on the paint but not replace the damaged front end apron).  Tesla's stance was that the car price was discounted in inventory (~$2K) and that discount covers the value of these items.   

&amp;nbsp;

Later that day (12/23)  - I placed another order and didn't search inventory - just configured the car I want and will wait.  I need to follow up with Tesla and find out what they will do with the refund of the car payment for the first vehicle so I can pay for the new one.   Nothing happens for a few days ( xmas and such).

&amp;nbsp;

Friday 12/27:  Text from the Tesla delivery scheduling system  - my order is ready to be delivered.   I had to check the order number because I originally thought (hoped) it was the new order even though that was unlikely to be the case.  It wasn't - it's the old vehicle again.

Per [my post](https://old.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/eh1ilz/doing_my_own_chrome_delete_after_getting_several/) yesterday, I did a DIY chrome delete, and I thought I'd share some pictures and takeaways from the experience. Here are all the pictures I took (with captions):

TLDR - [Before and after pic](https://imgur.com/UivEJbu)

[Album 1](https://imgur.com/a/KYlEn5b) - Door handles, emblems, and repeaters

[Album 2](https://imgur.com/a/DhCgBHl) - Window trim

**Why did I do it?** Not because I hate chrome, but I wanted a more two-tone look where the accents matched the Tesla rims. Especially with blacks and greys, I find that I just prefer fewer shades of color when they're close together. I also decided to do it myself because I was getting much higher quotes than I was expecting in the midwest, but I also wanted ALL the chrome deleted so I understood.

**What method did I use?** Plasti-dip, because it's cheap and, worst-case scenario, removable.

**What did it cost?** About $20 and roughly 12 hours of time, cumulatively.

**What did I learn?** A ton.
* First, the more closely you tape, the easier it's going to be later and the less you'll have to fix. Leave yourself an entire afternoon/evening, because you don't want to be rushed.
* A second person to help tape wouldn't be a bad move.
* I figured out a better knife technique when scoring along edges (lightly, don't worry), so if I did it again, I would be much better at it. The parts that came out good came out REALLY good, so I would be able to get that quality more consistently.

**Was it worth it?** Yes! It's not professional, and it's far from flawless, but it cost me $20 and will look great to the majority of people who will see it in passing. The good thing is I can always touch it up if I need to, and I'll do a better job in less time.

When I try to decode the VIN of a known Long Range and a known Performance, the 8th digit (""B"") is the same and indicates dual motor standard or performance. Someone surely knows an easy way to tell. Please let me know.

I figured that Tesla would make 2 different VIN indicators to separate either Long Range or Performance, as they mark the digit ""A"" for the base rear-wheel drive. I assume this means that the primary difference between the Long Range and Performance is simply software-based and nothing to do with the physical build, which also allows me to assume that you can upgrade your Long Range to Performance, but I don't know this to be true.",teslamotors,1577645573,TwoTinyTrees,22,1,True,2019-12-29

135,The Reality of Powering Your Home from the CyberTruck 240 Outlet,"TLDR: Powering your home from the CyberTruck without disconnecting the grid through a transfer switch (e.g. Powerwall gateway) or manual process will cause your truck to explode when grid power is restored as  it will almost always be out of sync with the grid.

Assuming there is enough amperage to power a home from the 240 outlet on the CyberTruck you will need to either have a manual or automated transfer switch installed at your home in order to switch safely back and forth between truck power and grid power.  

You can also do this manually by shutting off the main, connecting the truck and then doing the reverse when power is restored (I guess from seeing the neighbor’s power being restored assuming you have neighbors) Screw this up and you are likely to brick your truck at a minimum or create a nice fireball in your garage or driveway.

If Tesla does implement this feature the only officially supported way would likely be if a Tesla Powerwall gateway is installed and the truck would act as a supplement to any available Powerwalls.

Here is an article and video of a 27 ton generator connecting to the grid out of sync destroying the generator and jumping off its cement pad:

You are told to give them the key and they go get the car perform the service and return the car to the parking spot. Using basic sentry mode I was able to see two things:

1. The car got picked up using keycard. This video stopped right as he unlocked the door.

2. The car got dropped off and guy got out. This video started right at the end of the parking job.

I would have liked to see the in between part more. As in I wanted to see them pull the car into the garage and start the work as well as at the end see them back out of the garage at the end. As it stands it's not likely you will see that unless someone presses the button to record in the car throughout. I would love to trigger dashcam from my phone whenever.

I'm new to the whole EV world but I think its absolutely amazing how far these cars have come over the years.

I'm in the market for a used model 3 and live in California. I know California is Pro-EV and because of that I know they offer all sorts of rebates and or incentives for EV owners. If I'm not mistaken, the federal tax rebate is only for new EV purchases or leases so I don't think I would qualify for that.

With that being said, id like to save as much as possible for switching to an EV from an ICE vehicle because why not right?

You first need 2 smartphones. On both of them, the Tesla app has to be installed and connected to the car. 

One smartphone has to be in the car, with LTE and Wifi switched off but Bluetooth on and connected to the car.

On the other one, everything's on and it's also connected to the car. And that's the smartphone you summon your car with too.

Potential Model Y buyer here. I am looking at the Dual Motor AWD version. I don’t think I want the FSD upgrade but I do like that I can buy it later if I want. 

It seems like a lot of people are having issues with HW2.5 after the new update with stop signs and light detection, but the HW3 people are not. 

I’m expecting that at some point down the road, they’ll have HW4,5,6,7 etc. I do like that the existing cars can be retrofit but curious:

How much does a retrofit cost to go to HW2.5 to HW3 today? I’m hedging the bet on what it would cost to go from today’s HW3 to “4” down the road when they offer some new tech. 

Is there a “useful” life of obsolescence for HW3? Meaning at some point it will be discontinued for support and update purposes?

Assuming I love the car years down the road, can you retrofit multiple times? Meaning if I go from 3 to 4 in a few years, can I go 4 to 5 in another couple years? Computer power changes so quickly!

Shouldn't it just let me press the middle of the bar to skip straight to 50%?  It would save bandwidth and let me get to my content faster.

245,PSA: Disengage adaptive cruise in multi-lane interchanges,"Scary moment last night when I switched lanes going into a multi-lane interchange ([https://www.google.com/maps/@51.6801733,0.1242052,18.75z](https://www.google.com/maps/@51.6801733,0.1242052,18.75z)) and hadn't realised that I was still on adaptive cruise control (ACC).  I pulled out and accelerated during a straighter bit and then lifted off expecting some regen braking and just got acceleration.

What's a bit disturbing is that regen and now one pedal driving has trained me out of using the brake pedal except in an emergency, so I was left going into a tighter corner having not touched the brake pedal.

I think that's the most lateral G force my family have experienced and the car handled great, but it really wasn't a nice experience and has me not trusting Tesla's FSD tech when it comes to determining what speed is appropriate for a bend.

I'm sure there must be safer ways to deal with ACC (which is intended for on the highway) when it comes to tighter corners.  Certainly I've previously had Autopilot engaged and it's reduced and then increased speed as appropriate.

This is a welcome change as the horizontal screen is better for entertainment, however do we know whether or not they will keep the traditional dash as they have in current Model S/X?

He looked me up by VIN and then asked have you scheduled a service appointment yet ?

Is it programmed to try to avoid harming the animal even though it wouldn't necessarily put the driver and the car in danger were it to run the animal over?

And, by a similar logic, if there is an empty cardboard box laying on the street (you know it's empty because you can either see inside or its light enough to be moved by the wind), would the car stop?

[https://youtu.be/x7NJIkOirVE](https://youtu.be/x7NJIkOirVE)

The main reason I did this was I had some questions on the displayed range of the the car and wanted to see more detailed info from the car.  I am also a bit of a data whore so I love seeing this kind of info.     Some info on my car.    I am In Ontario Canada and got my car May 31, 2018.   It is a Model 3 LR RWD.    I have done around 26,500 kms so far.     Here is screen shots from scan my tesla app showing the data from about a week ago.   

[https://imgur.com/gallery/r8myKjn](https://imgur.com/gallery/r8myKjn) 

There is some overlap but you get to see the basic info.    My main concern was that my max charge in range seemed to be showing less then it should.    My last full charge was showing 460-ish kms.   This is compared to the 525 kms that is was supposedly changed to at one point.   When I got the car it would show right around 500 kms which is what the car was rated at when I got it.   Now I expected some degradation but not quite that much.    The data from the app seemed to confirm this.  If you look at the screen shots my nominal full pack number is 68.8 kWhs with 3.1 as the energy buffer.   In comparison to the Bjorn's info in the video above he is showing the nominal full pack as 73.5 kWhs with an energy buffer of 3.3 kWhs.    Now his car is newer then mine being an dual motor performance but it also has significant higher kms.  In the video above it is almost 40,000 kms compared to my 26,500.   He also supercharges far more as is DC charging total is 6051 kWhs verses mine at only 318 kWhs.    So my assumption  would be that a car that supercharges more like in Bjorn's case would have faster degradation but that doesn't seem to be the case.    My regen total is higher then his because he must do far more highway kms then me.    My regen total is 1759 kWhs verses 1111 for his.   

But just wondering if anyone else has info they would like to compare.    Just want to see where my numbers are at compared to others.",teslamotors,1577741471,zombienudist,35,1,True,2019-12-30

Max charge limit is not 100%. I simply couldnt slide the arrow in both app and car screen past around 90%

Longer detail:
Car had 9% battery, temp was around 40F degrees, I parked car, plugged in charger, then turn on departure at 7 AM. I then attempted to change charge limit to 95%, but the max (the end of ""trip"" portion) was capped at 88%.

Both phone and car screen showed the same % cap. 

Turned off departure with no difference.

I spent about 15 mins researching without seeing anyone else with the same issue. However, when I went back to the app, the max limit has now increased to 90%. After an hour or two, the max increased all the way to 100%

Thinking about a used and face lifted 2016 model S 75D FSD free charging vs a model 3 performance. 

I see older model S's now going just below the $30's. 

Thinking about total cost of ownership over say 5 years, even with another update to the S I'm thinking it shouldn't hurt the already depreciated used Model S's too bad. So maybe $30k after 5 years as a worst case. 

A brand new Model 3 stealth performance can be had for $50k, so in theory as a used car will go below $30k in 5 years.
That said, hard to think about buying a car with that performance and technology in 5 years for under $30k. Especially if older S's cost $30k at that time.

327,Autopilot Software - Resale/Transfer Debate,"Likely a repeat of bits and pieces of other comments and threads so starting a clean slate for hopefully an open debate. I am genuinely curious about others thoughts on this topic.

Please add/expand, correct and/or reshape any pieces I may have wrong or that you feel need better clarification. 

Essentially, there are a couple of camps regarding the FSD (or previously EAP, or the original separately purchased AP) software upgrade and whether it should be tied to the car or the original purchaser. 

There’s also a secondary debate on the “fairness” when Tesla strips software features from cars they buy, then look to resell, only to recharge for the activation of the previously stripped software.

My stance, at every step the consumer gets to make the decision on what’s fair or not and ultimately the market will decide if Tesla has made a smart business decision with their offerings.

Take Debate #1: Software Upgrades Tied to the Car or the Person

Sure, it would be sweet if we could just transfer the software package to our next Tesla Model, or resell it ourselves on the open market but for right now, the software is essentially still in the beta stages, and not fully released with all promised features. For the sake of the companies survival (and our future capability of getting to own and enjoy these cars), this revenue stream is just too vital to the company’s bottom line, plus it’s not like it’s free to develop, there needs to be a way for them to recoup the initial and ongoing R&amp;D expenses.

If you have a counter argument that keeps the company afloat, I am all ears.

Now Debate #2: Removing Software Packages on Used Cars only to Resell Them (Rinse and Repeat)

Brilliant on Tesla’s part. First they’re taking the risk of buying the used car in the first place (and the seller agreed to whatever price they offered). At this point Tesla can strip whatever they want from the car and the new potential buyer gets to decide if it’s a good value for what they’re asking compared to what they’re offering.

I don’t see where either debate is unfair. Yes, future competition will make pricing more affordable for buyers BUT first Tesla needed/needs to prove to the market this endeavor is actually profitable, because until recently and technically they’re still not a fully profitable company (holding lots of debt and not exactly a cash cow), they aren’t making money consistently.

They’re so close to proving the model is worthwhile, if they haven’t already. The competition will come in, which Musk openly planned for and encourages, and the market will decide if the above practices are tolerable.",teslamotors,1577759866,RyanBorck,51,1,True,2019-12-30

# Range Anxiety

I was a bit anxious when we left, I knew the car could easily handle 200+ miles / 320+ kms, but we still supercharged to 100% almost every night or mornings ""just to be safe"".

Real anxiety hit between Page, AZ to Zion, AZ. While the distance between these two locations is not that much for any Teslas (116 miles / 186 kms), the fact that we were staying in a hotel near Zion National Park that didn't have supercharger (closest one being St George, \~50 miles / 80 kms), that it was 28F / -2C, in a mountainous area with potential snow/ice on the way was stressful to say the least.

Thankfully when we arrived we found a destination charger that was available and were able to charge for a few hours while we did a small hike in the Park. But without that I was seriously considering skipping Zion entirely and driving directly to St George to supercharge.

They really should add a Supercharger around Kanab, UT imo, that would allow to recharge on the way to mountainous areas and have more options to explore, we really weren't able to do anything but go straight to Zion.

We also followed Tesla's recommendation to heat the car before leaving then turning off AC and only leaving seat warmers on. That worked well for the entire trip, I'm not sure how much mileage that saved us but it worked just fine!

# Supercharger network

We were probably a little over cautious, whenever we needed to charge we didn't do Tesla's recommended ""charge enough to reach next destination"" we almost always charged up to 90-95% during the day and 100% in the evening to prepare for the next day's travel.

I reckon that's actually a better strategy if you go on a long road trip, it allows to have sudden changes in your route to visit something that isn't necessarily on the way/planned.

Overall there wasn't any issues with locations of Superchargers, except for the one lacking around Kanab UT that would be really helpful.

However, there were several locations (Scottsdale, Sedona, Flagstaff) with multiple charging stations malfunctioning. Either the car would instantly stop charging and not provide any error message, or we would get the notification that the charging port was defective. Some poor guy we met unfortunately didn't notice that, and wasted 30 minutes when he got back to his car and find it was not charging.

The worst case being Flagstaff with 12 charging stations but only 7-8 of them working, and for some reason some worked for some cars but not others. We were lucky to always arrive before others, but I've had to swap up to 3 times before finding a working charger. Other drivers I met there reported the same issues.

We overdid it on the way back from Las Vegas to Irvine which was the single longest distance, but with a 3 yo in the back seat, it was needed to stop every 1h30 or so anyway so we just took that opportunity to charge a bit. Probably could have done it all with just 2 Supercharger stops (technically doable with a single one but I wouldn't wanna risk that!)

# Cold temperatures

We averaged 275 Wh/mile / 171 Wh/km which I find surprisingly good (my lifetime average is 263 Wh/mile). But the cold definitely ate some of our range, we would lose up to 10% a night in the really cold locations (Sedona, Flagstaff and Zion).

# Snow chains

Amazon was unable to deliver on time the snow chains that should have been much easier to install... (my fault I should have ordered them weeks ago). All I had were Laclede cable chains, which are a giant pain in the ass to put on but even more so on a RWD Model 3. The gap between the tire and fender is ridiculously small. I'm an average height man and I could not jam my arm between the gap to properly attach the read locks on those chains. I tried pressing so hard I've got two bruises on my left arm -\_-

Without the help of a good Samaritan in Flagstaff that saw me struggle for 10+ minutes I'd never would have been able to put them on properly and would have had to cancel one of our pre-paid visits (Lowell Observatory, awesome place!).

For context this is what Flagstaff [looked liked](https://imgur.com/RDrgM96.jpg) the morning after we arrived (my car is hidden behind that center tree on the 2nd row of cars). Definitely going to be getting some proper snow chains for our next trip to Mammoth!

# Trunk/Frunk

Really thankful for the frunk and the hole in the trunk. Without them we'd have had trouble carrying everything honestly. We were 4 on the trip (wife, mother in law, 3yo and myself), 2 medium size luggage and lots of bags for food/drinks/various stuff. I'm not sure how we would have made this trip in our Camry without my wife and MIL being really uncomfortable with extra bags at their feet.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, great trip, Navigate on AutoPilot drove probably 90% of the distance, with me doing the driving in cities and in snowing conditions (even then AP would work mostly fine just no NoAP). Several times my wife would stay in the hotel with my kid while I would go supercharge in the evening so we'd be ready the next day immediately, being able to watch The Witcher while charging was awesome :D

It’s not often I’ve witnessed it, but when I have, I’ve been lucky enough to park adjacent and plug the cable in - that’s going to be impossible with this installation. 

I wonder what people think to the idea. I remember many years ago wondering if this would ever be possible and we’d see wireless charging motorways so you wouldn’t ever have to stop to charge, just have a subscription or pay to use specific roads - like the M6 Toll.

408,What happens when someone bashes in your drivers side window.,"'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house not a creature was stirring, except three dick heads in a mid-nineties Honda Civic pulled up and bashed my drivers side window in.....

 So Christmas morning a group of guys bashed in my drivers side window at 4am (and two other cars around mine) looking for stuff to steal. Sentry was triggered and the alarm was very loud and it scared them off pretty quick. I didn't have anything in there to steal except my sunglasses in the arm rest but thanks to the alarm they didn't take anything. My phone was pinged and I got out to the car pretty quickly to see the aftermath. 

Sentry Mode recorded all the angles and I was able to give the cops the make and model of the car along with most of the license plate digits (they parked their car right in front of mine, the idiots. It was rainy and they were just a bit too far away for the plate to be completely clear). And I only got one or two decent frames of the guys face on the left repeater.

Also, the alarm is LOUD. My neighbors were pissed.

Turns out  the cops were able to track the car down in San Jose (I was in Burlingame) and it had been associated with other break ins, buuuuut it was stolen and had been abandoned. Even with the couple frames of the perps face, I was told there were no leads. Merry Christmas to me. 

After vacuuming up the glass and duct taping a couple kitchen trash bags over my baby's blackened left eye in a 5am broken Nyquil sleep stupor I went back to bed without a shred of faith in humanity. 

Until...Fast forward to the 27th. I was home for the holidays and live in Los Angeles so I had to figure out a way to fix this pretty quickly. I drove over to the Tesla Service Center in Burlingame, CA and they refer me to a nearby company that can help me (Precision in Burlingame). They were able to drive out to me and fix it up like new THE NEXT DAY! After all the stories I've read of getting windows replaced taking forever, it was a pretty nice surprise.  We were on the road back to LA that day.

413,Experience with Tesla Before Buying,"My wife and I were looking for new cars. A few months ago, I started reviewing stock for a Model S for myself and started looking at the Model Y for my wife.  I first tried to look at an X but ended up thinking that it had bad visibility out of the back, odd that it didn’t have a 360 degree camera, and super surprised that it was going to be well over $100k with FSD. 

I wanted to take advantage of the tax incentive after finding out that the showroom or slightly used demo Teslas had very low discounts. I realized this too late.  I thought I didn’t care about the tax incentive. 

I put a down payment for a Model Y and got that ordered a few weeks ago. At the same time I found a few decent Model S in stock. By the time I checked them out online and possibly wanted to look at them in the Tesla location, they were already sold.  I even called the advisor on the way over and he told me it was sold 10 min earlier and he told me to make sure to reserve it next time. Since then, no similar in stock models have been close. 

I took my wife today to the Tesla location for her to test drive a 3 (since it’s closest to a Y) and all showroom cars and test drive cars were “sold”. We couldn’t even test drive one. They had tons of “sold” cars in the lot so they couldn’t be used. 

I’m super frustrated. Two days ago the Tesla advisor had one possible car for me with performance non-all season tires and they wouldn’t swap them out for me. They asked me what they can do to help and have not helped. 

My only bet now is to order one and pick it up in a few weeks. I am a bit disappointed that there isn’t a better process. And I lose out on the tax incentive. 

I am also super worried about reselling them when the time comes. The Tesla locations have no used cars in stock. The advisor even told us to send them to Carvana which is crazy. He also said that if we trade them in, they just go to auction. 

I also realized that I see no Teslas on the CarMax app. I wonder why that is. 

I feel like Tesla needs to ramp up used cars. Many people would love a used Tesla because the price is a bit crazy otherwise.   These are all first world problems and it’s also crazy to me to see so many $110k cars are even listed and sold on the Tesla site. Did I miss something?  Are there tons of loaded people or people living above their means?

Also, the Tesla advisor said he gets no discount for Tesla. That’s a bit crazy. Why not make that a benefit of working there. If you work at a Disney store in the mall, you get tons of benefits including discounts on Walt Disney World or land. 

I’m just pretty much ranting. So far, the car tech and style seems sweet from watching YouTube videos and from a test drive I took a while back. I’m just frustrated.",teslamotors,1577824722,IT_info,26,1,True,2019-12-31

479,Here’s my fun Tesla experience.,"I placed an order for a Tesla 3 after sales guaranteed that I would take delivery by Christmas so I can get the tax credit. I placed a down payment of $27,000 and was pre-approved for an $18,000 loan from my credit union. Sold my car this morning. 

Tesla already moved my delivery twice, then this morning cancelled my order entirely by text - removed the VIN from my account, no apology or explanation. I called my sales person who said the car wasn’t even here, and the only way I can take delivery today is to pay $2,700 for a black car with fancy rims. Feeling like I had no choice, I paid the extra $2,700 so I could figure out next steps during the 7 day warranty. 

After waiting for three hours at the delivery center, dude comes over and said we don’t have your financing papers. I showed him what I received from the Credit Union, and he said it wasn’t enough, that I could wait two more hours to go through Tesla financing, but they won’t finance the fees so I would have to cough up another $5,000. 

I finally got home around 7:30pm without a car and had to cancel my order.

486,Feature Request: Wiper Service Mode on App,"Was reading over the cold weather tips for my Model 3 (again), and saw that it was recommended to leave your wipers in service mode to avoid them icing up. 

I believe that at least part of this is because the defrost doesn’t heat up the normal resting place of the wipers (and so they’re often frozen even worse as the melting from the defrost re-freezes). 

Service mode is hidden behind a few menu clicks, and I often forget to do it on my way into work. Would be nice to do this from the app. 

Additionally, it would be even better to let us park them up for a bit when we’re driving, as when it’s very cold (I live in MN), the wipers will freeze up on any setting other than full on, high heat defrost. Unfortunately, this heats up the cabin enough to be uncomfortable (especially since we’re usually wearing a jacket, often gloves and a hat in this weather).

For instance, in Germany, Austria and Switzerland we have Ionity Fast Charging that max out the Model 3 charging power. In summer, you get 240kW easy.
The problem we are facing in winter is that battery may need to be pre-heated more heavily and if preconditioning does not start on time, you get crappy lower speeds.
The workaround is to tell the car to drive to a nearby SuC then cancel the navigation once arrived to Ionity. This sucks. So either make the Nav software recognize other fast chargers or add a freaking button somewhere to tell it to precondition the battery! This has been a major complaint from many European YouTubers.

Seeing if there are others with opinions.

We have 3 kids and a big husky. We often commute over a long high speed highway so open pick up trucks are not ideal for dogs. But with the cybertruck, I'm now wondering if the side rails with the tonneau/cover closed now make this ideal for dogs. Thanks to the triangle design. It looks like there is a lot of space back there.

I guess this depends on a couple things. Top things that come to mind:

1) air circulation

2) open space with the cover closed

I know in many places it's illegal to have a dog ride in the bed of a pickup so there's that issue too.

https://i.imgur.com/AYJ2rcd.jpg

The relay attack is very serious, leads to loss of the car and it is easy to launch. 

Thieves come to your house, point a small antenna to it, this picks up the signal from the key fob and relays it to the car. The car thinks the key is near it and unlocks. Thieves get in the car and drive away. 

The solution seems to be simple: add a g-sensor to the key, and disable it if it’s not moving. If it’s in someone’s pocket, it is moving, so it will work fine. If it’s on the desk in the front room, it’s disabled. 

No other automaker has cared to fix this. They pretend the issue doesn’t exist. Turns out the solution is extremely easy, but it requires a certain level of innovation that others simply don’t have. 

The fix is a testimony to the innovative thinking and culture of continuous improvement at Tesla. Should have gotten more publicity than just a note in the manual.

62,Cybertruck - where will the spare tyre(s) go?,"There doesn't seem to be a good place on Cybertruck to carry a spare.

At least one spare is essential for a working vehicle. Where I live in slightly rural Australia off road vehicles (working or recreational) will frequently carry two.

Usually on a ute, it would be under the bed, flush vertical against the back of the cab, or flush against the back of the canopy if you have one (and hence don't have or use a tailgate). Some people chuck it (or the 2nd one) up on the roof rack, tho of course that affects handling and aero.

On Cybertruck, i'm pretty sure there's no room under the bed - that's where motors/batteries are.

Up against the back of the cab may be possible but it doesn't look tall enough for the bed cover to still work - although it's hard to tell with the images available. Don't suppose someone at the reveal took that dimension?

And the tailgate precludes flush against the tail - unless you have it on a swing-away carrier which would be an expensive option and a pain to have to open every time before opening the tailgate.

More creative options like the olde Landrover hood mount also don't seem to make sense for many reasons. On a roof rack?

Of course you can just lay it flat on the bed, but that loses you quite a bit of area...",teslamotors,1574984575,kiwinigma,0,1,True,2019-11-28
64,Unchosen prototype headlight of Model S &amp; current headlight samsara (durability issue),"Dozens of Model S owners here in Taiwan had reported headlight replacements for 2-5 times a year!

DRLs, suppose to emit white, turned yellow after 1-4 months EVERYTIME until you get out of this samsara.

Yes, it's under warrenty, but it's extremely time-consuming and bothering!

We wonder who is the supplier and WHY IT'S NEVER FIXED?

&amp;#x200B;

Well, we didn't find the answer.

However, we found that a company in Taiwan is the supplier of taillight, and there is a prototype headlight of Model S on its website.

I just want to share it.

BTW, since Taiwan owners are minority for Tesla globally, I will be much appreciated if you can help to file a complaint against endless headlight replacements of Model S.

65,"Update 2019.40.1.1 Notes and Review - Lane Changes Rock, Changing Out of Passing Lane is Broken","So I got 2019.40.1.1, but it seems Tesla may have pulled this one shortly after sending it out...

**Deep Rain**

It isn't raining here, but I did poor some water from a watering can on the windshield and it worked great. The wipers were actually a little overzealous and kept wipe long after the windshield was clean.

I also tested a very small amount of fine mist from a spray bottle, and the wipers detected it immediately. It seems improved, but until real world scenarios we won't know *how* improved.

&amp;#x200B;

**More Confident Lane Changes**

Ohhhhh buddy these are amazing. When you hit the turn signal to make a lane change, you barely get past one click and the car starts to change lanes. MUCH more similar to the way I and many others change lanes. 

When using Navigate on Autopilot, when the car initiates the lane change itself, it still waits probably 3 or 4 clicks before it starts changing lanes. I get why Tesla would do this, but I turned on non-confirm so the car would do it, so I wish it was just as fast as when I hit it myself, but I'm sure we'll get there eventually.

&amp;#x200B;

**Changing Out of Passing Lane is Broken**

I was in the passing lane for over 20m for my test drive today. There isn't much traffic due to thanksgiving, and the car did not ONCE try to exit the passing lane. It did pass slower drivers tho. All testing on MadMax.

&amp;#x200B;

**Autopilot has a new minimum** ***set*** **speed**

People were confused by what I meant when talking about this earlier. Yes, AP could always go to 0 with a lead car, but the lowest you could set TACC/AP was 18mph. So if you set it from a dead stop, the car would immediately start going forward. Now you can set AP to 0 and it will slow down, completely stop, and just sit there. The lowest speed (besides 0) is now 2mph. Not sure why they skipped 1mph haha

**Video Examples**

If you're interested, I made a video about this update here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sGOY0nUv68](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sGOY0nUv68)

&amp;#x200B;

I realize Reddit is not always the most accepting to YouTubers and their goofy thumbnails, and I get it, so I typed out everything for you in case you don't want to watch the video.

If you have any questions, happy to answer them! Happy updating!

Instead of the usual political discussions that bring about divisive drama during my family's Thanksgiving, I decided it would be better to discuss the Cybertruck. I figured it would be a fun way to get people arguing instead of the nastiness that politics bring out. 


To my astonishment, everyone hates the Cybertruck except for me! I found myself defending it repeatedly against all of my family. They just can't get over the design. I dunno. I don't mind it. I currently own a 2016 Dodge Ram, and previously owned a 2000 Dodge Ram from 2006 to 2016. While I've always loved Rams, I would absolutely trade up to a Cybertruck.

I was just at a Tesla Supercharger charging my 2014 Model S 85. The particular charger was really slow so I unplagged and parked by a different charger thinking that one might be faster. As soon as I plugged in, it gave this warning.
“DC Fast Charging / Supercharging disabled (Try AC Charging).

Is it harmful to plug in my car which isn’t 250kw compatible to a 250w charger?

First best option: be rich and pay cash.

Second best option: start saving now and full pay when it comes out (assuming Jan 2023 delivery date) 

Third best option: pay 20% down and finance the rest.

There are lots of other options depending on your situation, but this is what I came up with. Rounded sales tax up to 10%, so you can adjust yours as necessary. 

Hope someone finds this useful- I'm a spreadsheet amateur so forgive any errors and am welcome to feedback!

103,Cyber Truck feature details,"I am super excited for the Cyber Truck and think that it looks like it could totally revolutionize the truck industry. I've put a reservation in for a tri-motor. I think we can all agree that the specs of the truck are amazing. There are still a number of important details that have yet to be released. I realize they are likely milking the hype, which is good. There are also likely things that that haven't quite figured out yet. There have been a number of reoccurring topics if like to hear people opinion about.


Tailgate: In the reveal demo the tailgate ramp is awesome but it looked cumbersome. I would like to see an automated ""slow ramp"" tailgate. This could possibly be achieved with the onboard air compressor.

Vault access from interior: I think it would be essential for the back window to roll down. Or even better, to have a ""mid cab"" opening like the Avalanche. This would make the bed ""full size"" and would make the camper setup a lot more useful

5th wheel: is it possible? This matters to a lot of people (myself included) I think it could be possible providing there is enough structure under the bed to support the weight.

Roof hardware: I've seen a couple pics of the attachment points on the roof which is excellent. I'm hoping we see lots of options for different roof racks and such. 

Frunk and side boxes: did any of the people at the event get a higher resolution picture of the slides that show these storage areas? I'm guessing there are plugs and the compressor outlet in one of the side sails. How big is the frunk? Would also be cool to see an integrated cooler/mini fridge in one of these spaces.

Mirrors: I actually really like the look without the mirrors and I would be ok without them BUT they better work excellently all the time. Would like to see a composite image from multiple cameras of the 180° behind the driver displayed on the ""rear view mirror""

Water depth: surely the CT is sealed enough to wade through some deep water and mud. The Rivian truck claims to be able to go through 3 feet of water with the only limiting factor being that it floats and could go deeper if it was weighted down. After posting the clip from ""The spy who loved me"" on reveal day I was disappointed he didn't even mention this.

On board power specifications: We know there is 120v, 240v and on board compressed air but no specs have been released about amperage or CFM. 

House backup power: I assume this would be pretty straight forward if your house is setup to be disconnected from the grid. I'm surprised this hasn't already been done for current models. Anyone have insights as to why?

Ice resistance: I live in Texas but I wonder about colder climates since this is likely not going to fit in most garages. Could there be some integrated heating elements? With no paint to mess up you might be able to hit it with (not a) flamethrower.

Some of these things I feel are essential and some are just dreams. What kind of details do you think we'll see emerging in the coming months? Got any feature requests?",teslamotors,1575000132,Elemental-Design,15,1,True,2019-11-28

Like inuse my current truck which means hauling, towing, all the ""truck"" things. 

As I was unloading some stuff at the dump yesterday I noticed the bed of my truck and immediately something clicked. I love the idea and concept of the rail system and the flexibility it offers, but my truck bed currently (and often) has a lot of debris, dirt, sticks, etc. in it. You know, because of actual truck stuff. Right now it's as easy as washing it, sweeping it, or let's face it, leaving it for awhile. The grooves for the rail system seems they would be an utter nightmare when it comes to this dirt and debris, etc. In all honesty, if it isn't addressed and acknowledged in a meaningful way it may be a deal breaker. Not just for me, but for a lot of folks who plan on actually using it for working.

195,Thoughts After 3 Months of Being a Tesla Owner...," My first ever post to Reddit. Be gentle...or not.

So it's been exactly 3 months since I picked up my Model S LR:

[\\""Jarvis\\""](https://preview.redd.it/30d5ojvrmn141.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eaed0cc53523136cdfbec8fa4ac303bd35c9e69c)

In that time, it's delivered in every way I expected. Best car I've ever owned - by a large margin. Sorry Lexus. But it's also led to some unexpected consequences that I wanted to share for anyone thinking of buying a Tesla...

* It took me a while to break the habit but I don't care what gas prices are doing this week.
* I'm walking more than ever because I find myself parking 6 miles away from anyone. Yes, I am saying that cardiologists should be recommending Tesla.
* I rarely use Autopilot. I'm a software guy and yes, it's amazing but the best part of this car is driving it.
* Driving the wife's car (Lexus) is now the equivalent of watching VHS AFTER you've seen HD. It's dirty and wrong.
* Cincinnati offers free parking for EVs downtown. Which is perfect because...
* I'm stocking up on quarters. There's no way I'm taking it through a machine car wash. Self-service only.
* Target should be paying Elon. I've spent more money at Target in the past 3 months than I have in the past oh...ever. That happens to be the closest supercharger to me. No, I haven't had the home charger installed yet. I'm too busy driving, leave me alone. 
* Plus, the 120V charger is fine for the majority of my driving needs.
* I am anticipating that life of my brakes will be 1 million miles or infinity, whichever comes first.
* See a Porsche or Corvette in front of me, I feel like it's my duty to pass them. I can't help it
* Which leads to my final learning - with the money I'm saving on gas, I'm clearly going to pay for that in speeding tickets. Definitely missing Waze. That said, I'd rather my money support my local community than BP.

215,Wondering if the stainless steel alloy that will be used in the Cybertruck is susceptible to stress corrosion cracking.,"I know that higher strength/hardness stainless steels can be prone to embrittlement and failure in corrosive environments, especially when the material is under stress. See article:

[http://www.ssina.com/corrosion/stress-corrosion-cracking.html](http://www.ssina.com/corrosion/stress-corrosion-cracking.html)

I was wondering if anyone knew more about the alloy used in the Cybertruck. I'm assuming that some of those panels will be under a lot of stress (not being body on frame, and also residual stresses from the manufacturing process), and also exposed to road salt and the resultant brine for extended periods of time in some regions.

One problem with stress corrosion cracking (SCC) is that it can cause catastrophic failure without presenting much of a pitted/rusted appearance.

236,Update: Diminished Value claim for Model 3 accident,"This is a follow-up and conclusion to a few posts I've made since the summer. My Model 3 was hit/run in a parking lot. SentryMode caught the whole thing on video and eventually deciphered the license plate of the guy who hit/run run me - [post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/cfpbed/it_happened_to_me_too_parking_lot_hitrun_caught/) and [post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/cg3jil/update_it_happened_to_me_too_parking_lot_hitrun/). Once the insurance claims were filed and the other guy was officially listed as the at-fault driver, and the repairs were made and paid for (and reimbursed expenses to me), I pursued a Diminished Value claim. For this, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/cq8vle/to_all_model_3_owners_whove_been_in_an_accident/) asking for data about any redditors experiences in this area. There didn't seem to be much personal experience, but u/PaleInTexas suggested AutoLoss.com. .... so with that whole introduction out of the way, here's the updated.

I hired Auto Loss and at first worked with Monica. She was responsive and helpful. AutoLoss provided me with boilerplate documents in which my scenario's details were pasted in, and I was directed to submit them to the insurance adjuster. AutoLoss never visually inspected my car, but based on details and the repair invoice, they suggested that the DV was ~$4800 (P.S. 2018 Model 3 LR RWD, first prod; $2600 of body damage on rear door and quarter panel, no structure damage). When I submitted that number to State Farm, they wanted an 'independent' appraisal of their own, for which they arranged and paid. Based on that appraiser's report, SF offered me $1800.

Any time I received any communication from State Farm, I forwarded it to Auto Loss and either Monica or Jesse would respond. Not immediately but in a day or two. They asked me to take my car to CarMax for an appraisal to buy it. I told CarMax everything about the accident, but I didn't mention anything about the DV claim. They are probably wise to the process, and wouldn't appreciate knowing that I never had any intention of actually selling. But I needed a real offer to know how much value was lost in the car's worth. AutoLoss and State Farm's appraiser both agreed that my car (pre-accident) was worth somewhere around $47k-$48k. CarMax's offer to buy was $37k. Obviously, CarMax's offer has their desired profit margin built in, but this offer demonstrated that my car had lost much more than $1800 worth of value.

I counter-offered to StateFarm at $4500. Of course, the adjustor is a professional negotiator, trying to pay as little as possible. So the conversations included lots of reason why he can't/won't pay that. He also told me that State Farm was very familiar with AutoLoss and was often unrealistically high in their valuations in their experience. He also told me that some of the claims had gone all the way to court and the car owner was stood up by AL because they didn't show. After all these reasons, State Farm offered me $2300.

It was clear to me and the adjuster that the claim wasn't going to be settled for $2300 and it wasn't going to be settled for $4500. I don't know how often these DV claims actually go to court, but I was starting to feel confident because the $10k difference between what **their appraiser** said was the pre-accident value, and the real/valid offer to buy from CarMax, told me that the number was closer to my position to theirs.

I explained all of this to the adjuster. I told him that I imagine that he has a large case load, that his boss wouldn't like to see this claim go unsettled, and that he was spending a lot of valuable time with me that could all go away - to settle for the middle at $3300. I told him he has 48 hours to get back to me.

At the 49th hour after not hearing anything from him, I sent the adjuster an email telling him the price just went up to $4100. An hour later, I got a phone call offering me $3000 and I agreed.

So I'm posting all of this for two reasons. First, to put some data out there about Diminished Value data for others to benefit from if anyone ends up in a similar situation. Second, to try to shed some light on the whole process of dealing with insurance company for a DV claim.

For comparison, here is the Model 3 launch test drive video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SWVS56aZU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SWVS56aZU)

Looks like in the Model 3 the UI all the interior hardware is the same, so how will Cybertruck pull this off? The short-term conclusion is, no it cannot omit the stalks just yet, but I would like to know if there's a new way to do things.

256,So I did my first test drive today,"Had a interview that got pushed back, so I happened to be right by the dealership. I figured what the hell at least do a test drive and see if I enjoy it as much as others do. My experience was great from a customer service standpoint, didn't feel rushed or even bothered for that matter, I told the guys right off the bat that I wasn't looking to buy for awhile since I still have 4 years of payments left on my Ford, they totally understood and even on Black Friday didn't feel rushed at all, so kudos to the staff at my dealership.

&amp;#x200B;

Now on to the test, the salesman took me out to a model 3, not sure which version I was in, but after a quick little basic tour, I was off on the road...by myself, never done a test drive where I was solo in the car, that was neat. The car itself was great, it really does change your perspective when you're actually in one vs seeing pictures or YouTube videos. Took me a little bit of playing with the settings to get to a comfortable driving mode, my biggest thing was the regenerative braking, never been in a car that brakes as soon as your foot is off the gas pedal, or a car that doesnt creep when it is in gear. I got on the highway and tested out the autopilot, which as advertised was a cool feature, felt a little bit of resistance from the steering wheel when I first engaged it, not sure if that is a normal thing. 

The seats exceeded my expectations, I've heard of how comfortable they are, but man the reviews do not do them justice, truly a comfortable ride, I could definitely see myself on a long road trip in one. My only thing was the 15 inch touchscreen took a few minutes to get used to, but with time I would know it like the  backhand, reminds me of my iPhone, which was probably the point of their design.

All in all it was a short but wonderful experience, I can certainly see myself driving in one, just got to stay the course with my current car payments, and then maybe with a little luck in a few years I'll be back to the dealership to get one.

I drove back straight home today in the expected 14 hours. 5 of those hours were taking breaks while supercharging. This was actually great because I got out of my car and ate or walked around and got refreshed for a few more hours of driving. The longest leg was 130 miles and I made it to the supercharger with about 30 miles to spare.

369,I need an SUV. I want a Model Y but Toyota just announced a RAV4 PHEV that gets 39 all electric miles. Its cheaper than Y...im torn.,"My daily commute to work is approx 31 miles round trip. That's most of my driving. I put about 8k miles on my car each year. I'm currently driving a 2007 Honda civic that's still in good condition engine-wise and about 110k miles. I can probably keep driving it another 5 years. I'm in New York to give you an idea about climate.

The thing is, I've got a toddler and my 2nd baby will be born in a few weeks. My wife hates the idea of getting an all electric vehicle but I've heard the stories about test drives so I'm not concerned with that. I'm concerned with being practical. If that tax credit were still available for the teslas I'd be all over it. 

I can afford a Y LR RWD but... I can also use the ""saved"" money to pay off my house sooner. 

Is there anyone that can offer some advice in this situation?  Should i wait another year for the SR model Y?  Should i just go for the RAV4 Prime PHEV?",teslamotors,1575124152,ForTheB0r3d,195,1,True,2019-11-30

379,Thoughts on likely driving dynamics of the Y vs 3,"I realize this is all just speculation right now until people get a chance to actually test drive the Y, but I'm curious if anyone has any thoughts on how the Y will drive relative to the 3. I currently have a 3 on order, but I've considered cancelling and putting money down on a Y. More space would be nice, and the Y would be great for the dog (65lbs). On the other hand, I absolutely love the way the 3 drives, and think I would be pretty disappointed if the Y ends up being too much less enjoyable.

I currently own a BMW 335 and have had X3 35i loaners from the dealership. The X3 and the 335 share the same engine and (I believe) the same frame, but there is a huge difference in driving dynamics. The 335 is a legitimately fun car to drive (not as fun as a Tesla, but still), whereas the X3 feels pretty tight for a crossover/SUV, but is pretty far from fun.

I've had this same experience test-driving or owning other makes and models of cars in the past - the version of the car that sits slightly higher up (e.g. Subaru Outback vs Legacy) or has a larger body attached to the same platform and engine invariably feel far less engaging and fun to drive.

I realize this is a natural tradeoff and you just have to decide which end of the tradeoff is worth it. But I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts on just how big the driving dynamics difference will be in the Y vs. the 3? The published 0-60 times for the X vs the 3 are 0.3 seconds apart, while the difference between the 335 and the x3 35 are 0.4 seconds apart, which leads me to believe that the relative differences might be similar. I've also read that the Model X is a pretty different driving experience than the S, which might mean that the 3 vs the Y will be pretty different. 

Anyone have any speculation they'd like to share?",teslamotors,1575128286,Trent_A,16,1,True,2019-11-30

407,Cybertruck still uses stamping presses,"A big selling point of the Cybertruck presentation is that this vehicle doesn't require stamping of metal due to the shape and material chosen (triangular stainless steel) which will reduce overall weight, and cost. 

I just noticed, while looking at the [Cybertruck](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck) webpage, that it absolutely does use stamped metal in its manufacture. If you look at the 3rd picture on that link (shown below), you'll see that the internal part of the Unibody appears to be all stamped metal. Which suggests that it also isn't Stainless Steel, due to the incredible challenges of stamping SS. Which also suggests that this vehicle will still require some sort of corrosion protection, usually applied in the form of paint.

415,My first road trip experience with a Raven Model X,"So my household owns two Teslas. I daily drive my model 3 and absolutely love it. Even with it being the AWD non performance model, the acceleration is exhilarating. 

My mother daily drives the model X in our family and we live in the middle of Mississippi. One might think being in this state the infrastructure is nonexistent but surprising Tesla opened a service center (lite) literally 25 minutes away from me and it’s helped us feel more at ease since when we bought both of these cars we were under the impression we would be dealing with Tesla’s mobile service. 

Anyway, even with the few reservations my parents had, for the most part they have rather enjoyed the model X. Fast forward (or perhaps flashback?) to yesterday where we decided to take a trip down to New Orleans for some shopping extravaganza. (Black Friday amirite?) my mother knew that charging would be a thing as we went 200 miles down to New Orleans with our model X raven long range that has 325 miles. 

I let it charge to 100 percent and the trip there really wasn’t bad at all. We charged for 30 ish minutes in McComb and went down to New Orleans without a hitch. We had to drive around a little while we were there so we had to stop at Slidell on the way back. My mother being full of range anxiety (couldn’t really blame her) we had to stop back at mccomb as well just the sake of our sanity. This being our first time, getting home with 17 percent might have been a bit much. We figured we would shoot past the estimated state of charge on arrival due to going 80 the whole way but it didn’t seem like it. All in all I really wish the malls in New Orleans had superchargers. Seems they are building one there now and it would certainly make trips much easier. It seems Baton Rouge has plenty of chargers, super and even destination.

It's a whopping AUD$180,000, which directly exchanges to USD$121,733.  Granted the sticker price includes shipping, taxes and compliance costs but obviously there is a very fat margin.

Now compare this to the dual motor Cybertruck in Australia, which should sell for between AUD$80,000 to AUD$90,000.  Who in there freakin mind would pay double for the lower specified F150 Raptor?

479,Cybertruck Illustrates Tesla's True Boldness: Where Could/Should They Go Next?,"The Cybertruck demonstrated to me without a doubt that electric vehicles are an opportunity to bring about great change to the auto industry. Going away from this gradual incrementalism, with the new business model of preordering, I think new niches of vehicles could be met.

One of the primary niches I haven't seen exploited is the off-road van. I think this niche is the most versatile niche imaginable. It gives you a big vehicle to haul things in, go camping in on easy weekend trips, go off-roading in for fun

And they can come in more sizes too. I.e. a SMALL off-road van doesn't exist in the consumer market, but a very high demand military vehicle which does the same thing exists:

https://www.carsbase.com/photo/steyr-daimler-puch/steyr-daimler-puch-pinzgauer-710-mk958-pic71364.jpg

The Pinzgauer is a famous vehicle among overlanders. It's one of my favorite vehicles ever and if no automaker meets my demand for one when I am in the right point in life to buy one, I will end up with one. I'd basically sell my soul for a Cyberpinzgauer.

The other van niche is that of the large camper van: 

https://gearpatrol.com/2019/09/11/this-4-wheel-drive-ford-camper-van-is-an-overlanding-beast/

Another niche could be an off-road car with that air-ride suspension. So, think Subaru Outback and Subaru WRX rolled into one vehicle with Tesla performance and styling. Smaller, easier to park, good for quick weekend warrior camping trips, road trips and also has an extremely good Nürburgring time thanks to its low center of mass and coefficient of drag.

The possibilities are just so endless that it would be a disappointment if they just returned to making only ""normal"" cars after Cybertruck.",teslamotors,1575178906,Irredactable,0,1,True,2019-12-01

497,Near-term regulatory approval of hands-off highway-only FSD and permitting higher speed limits for highway-autonomous vehicles,"Looking back at my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/dd4m6v/the_benefits_of_sleeping_in_a_full_self_driving/) about sleeping in a FSD Tesla, I realized that this dream could be much closer than I originally thought. While the Tesla fleet taxi service would require off-highway FSD, there would be a huge benefit to allowing hands-off FSD for highway driving only. And highway-only FSD is much easier to do. You could even argue that it's already safer than a human without Autopilot.

Tesla owners could handle the last mile of getting to and from the highway ramps and use highway FSD to travel hundreds of miles while sleeping. This is especially exciting because I think we're pretty close to highway FSD being considerably safer than human drivers. I know the red tape will be a big hurdle but what do you guys think of the below possibility:

* A regulation within the next couple years or even months allowing government-approved autopilot systems to go without human supervision exclusively on highways.

* This has the tremendous benefit of letting Tesla owners sleep on the way destinations, which effectively makes journies of hundreds of miles take zero time. It would work like this:

1. Since it has to start on a highway, you would have to drive to the nearest rest stop, then hop in the back, and hit go.

2. Catch some Zs while the Tesla drives to the rest stop immediately before your destination, auto-parks, and wakes you up to take over.

3. If any issues arise on the journey, the Tesla pulls over to the highway shoulder, puts on the hazard lights, and wakes the occupant up.

On top of this, it's also possible that a regulation could be passed to allow highway FSD cars to travel faster. I know I'm really reaching here but imagine being able to wake up 1000+ miles from where you live every morning.

If you are coming up on a red light, it's paradoxically better to slow down and try to time it so you reach the intersection at full speed or at least a decent speed. Not that Tesla's are slow to accelerate from a stop but this would save energy and just be an awesome feature. Also, you could accelerate less quickly and thus save energy if you knew the red light around the corner would be green when you got to it. I think probably this would be a FSD feature. I'm not sure how much of a difference it would really make but it would be an awesome selling point and stoplight timing data may be useful to Tesla in other ways like further improving FSD.",teslamotors,1575195591,Intro24,5,1,True,2019-12-01

25,Navigate on Autopilot Failure,"I'm seeking input on an issue I'm experiencing.  I've voiced my concern with Tesla and have an open service request which has been pushed to the right while Tesla reviews the data.  I am feeding them videos and timestamps regarding a failure to recognize lanes, including inability to use Navigate on Autopilot as intended.  The problem extends to county and city roads which are clearly marked, and somewhat navigable on V9 software.  Since I've owned the car I've experienced what seemed to be erratic responses to detected(properly or not) lanes in the form of automated driving assistance contributing to a less than favorable experience.  With the V10 update, the symptoms only grew worse.  Most notably, I can't use cruise control because the car reacts as though my car is constantly in the wrong lanes which are constantly jumping around, and at least 60% of other cars are either in my lane on a collision course with me, or spinning out of control like some sort of ""Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift"" competition.  I've confirmed via TeslaCam that the cameras are producing footage consistent with other uploads on YouTube; not the greatest, but consistent.  I have no confirmation from Tesla that the specific issue has been identified or confirmed with other drivers, and frankly, very little interaction in total, except requesting time to review the data.  I started feeding data in Early October, and am generating more every day.  It feels like my voice is too quiet to be heard by anyone that can or will do anything about it, or I'll be on an indefinite hold.  If I'm alone, that's okay to know about an edge-case, but the other direction would be that others experience this too, and aren't talking about it.  Could be very bad.  I'm hesitant to share the specifics yet, but if I can't get anyone to work with me, at some point I'll feel obligated to share everything.

32,Tesla Solar Rental - Early Adopter Absolute Nightmare,"Here's my story and i hope it helps people decide on the solar rental in the future.  I'd like to premise this with i was initially a huge fan of the idea of solar rental through tesla.  This experience has changed everything.

I signed up in Sept for the TESLA rental program for the $1500 removal fee waived deal.

I received no communication from anyone.  Just got a text saying here's my installation date.  I was fine and totally ok with that.  New technology and all.  All documents are online to sign.

Fast forward to the installation date.  In October when they were ready to install a crew of 5 guys came out here and they were very cool and nice guys.   This is where things went wrong fast.  They installed the panels on my roof.  They look gorgeous btw(see photo).  AFTER they installed the panels, they said there was an in issue with my main panel and that i needed some grounding work to be done by my electrician ($200 worth).  I paid for that work and then i called them back.  They then told me i needed a new permit($300).   The day of the installation my Tesla energy rep was conveniently unavailable as well so i couldn't even get a hold of anyone at tesla for clarification of what was happening.  In fact, no one got back to me for 4 days after this half installation had taken place.

So right now, i have a half installed system.  The panels are all installed but the electronics and wiring are tied off and Tesla is telling me if i dont spend $300 on a new permit they'll come and remove the panels after already putting holes in my roof.  The whole idea of the rental was that it was supposed to be a ""free installation"".  Instead i'm being held hostage,  if i dont spend another $300 on a permit they remove the panels which they already put holes in my roof on.

The rental plan doesnt even save you that much 30-40 a month.  So i have a choice of either spending $300 + the 200 i already did or they come and remove my panels after already putting holes in my roof and on the side of my house.

Attached a photo of the guys installing.

TLDR: Tesla will install your panels first then tell you if you don't spend X-Y-Z after they'll remove them.

41,My Tesla Insurance Claims Experience,"Hello all, I, like many of you, have been wondering how Tesla Insurance handles collision claims, and whether or not their customer service is up to par.  I recently had the misfortune of getting into 2, not-at-fault, back to back accidents with my 3 week old P3D- (All parties involved are okay!  Nobody was hurt). I've filed claims using my own Tesla Insurance to repair my car, and wanted to let the community know the process and my thoughts.

-	Claim is being handled by a third party carrier, [Crawford and Company](https://www.crawco.com)
-	Adjuster assigned to my cases is very responsive, answers all my phone calls.  The only downside is that I’m in California and she’s based in Alabama, the 3 hour time difference can really screw up timing and plans
-	The “in-network” rental is a covered Enterprise rental for up to $75/day, I was able to get a Model S 75D rental for up to a month.
- I was lucky to have an “Exotics” Enterprise around my area, there definitely isn’t a guarantee that you get an electric vehicle at all.

Timeline of Events: 

- **Thursday October 3** - First accident - [rear bumper and rear quarterpanel damage](https://i.imgur.com/zys2nUj.jpg).

- **Saturday October 5** - Second accident - [severe front end damage](https://i.imgur.com/VRwX3nJ.jpg), airbags deployed.  [Vehicle disabled](https://i.imgur.com/6y75GEk.png) and was towed to a nearby tow lot.

- **Monday October 7** - Model S rental obtained from Enterprise.

- **Thursday October 10** - Car towed from tow lot to Tesla Operated Body Shop - Pomona, CA.  Quoted 6-8 weeks (!!!) for all repairs.

- **Tuesday October 15** - Estimate for front damage received - $22,000 - Tesla estimator did not anticipate any delays or issues with part orders.

- **Wednesday October 16** - Estimate for rear damage received - $8,000.  Quoted time updated to 4 weeks, estimated pickup date November 16.

- **Monday October 21** - My insurance adjuster approved both repairs and issued payment checks for both repairs - repairs commenced.

- **Tuesday October 29** - I received both payment checks in the mail, body shop updated that repair should be done in about a week or two.

Final thoughts:

All in all a positive experience, both with Tesla Insurance/Crawford and Co, and the guys at the Pomona Body Shop.  I hope this helps the people on the fence about swapping over to Tesla Insurance. 
 I personally feel that the $75/day rental coverage is more than worth the hassle of swapping.  My old insurance carrier only covered up to $40 a day for a car rental.  Let me know if you guys have any more questions!",teslamotors,1572398683,mapor12,131,264,True,2019-10-29

Mine has been like this since they first added them to the UI, which I think was v9? I've reported it to Tesla. Curious how many else noticed it too. Haven't heard or seen anyone mention it before.

In my example the car behind me is a little more than the midway point of the car beside me, but the instrument cluster shows it behind the other car. The position of cars beside me are usually quite accurate. It's just those directly behind that seem to be 2x further than they actually are.

81,Idea for a Tesla Student Driving mode,"Tesla has an opportunity to fit itself securely into the niche market of Driving Schools and Student Drivers, and the best part is that it would only take a simple software solution to do it.

In Tesla's Student Driving mode, Tesla's safety features would feed the information to the main display before it becomes necessary to physically correct you. With that information, a driving instructor can coach the student through Tesla's feedback. There could also be a sensitivity level that the driving instructor selects which may have Tesla correcting earlier than it normally would while providing its feedback to the main display.

With its advanced safety features, Tesla can already be argued to be a wonderful vehicle for student drivers, but if Tesla leaned into that and added the specific software to truly enable student drivers and driving instructors, their safety, the safety of other drivers, and the sheer level of instruction can all be enhanced.

112,Visiting showroom for first time,"My family is planning to visit a showroom this weekend (the Colorado ones and the one in KC are unfortunately equally close). Equally close means it's a good  5+ hour drive. Don't get me wrong, we're using the whole weekend as a getaway and plan on doing some other fun things on the way, but I'm worried about travelling far and not getting enough out of the visit to be worthwhile.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm reading reviews online about some people who have experienced showing up at a showroom and being told they had to schedule a test-drive in advance, but others say it's really easy.

I'm hoping to try out both a Model 3 and Model X with my family. I hope testdriving with a couple carseats is allowed? Obviously, testing the car with carseats is pretty logical for us. I also hope it isn't too much to ask to 

I have a little concern about showing up and honestly telling them that I'm not looking to buy yet (rather, plan to get more serious in the summer); do they ignore you or even disallow testdrives to people who they don't perceive as serious shoppers?

Finally, do these showrooms offer much else for simply wanting to learn more about the cars up close, other than test drives? 

&amp;#x200B;

123,Phones and fobs: inconsistent proximity detection,"TL;DR Just some observations on inconsistent behavior with two phone keys and four new key fobs. It's long, and probably only interesting to a couple of pedantic people who have seen strange behavior with new fobs.

My household has two iPhones we have paired as keys and four of the new-style key fobs (""TESLA"" logo on bottom, has the proximity sensor).

The phones were generally okay before this latest update. Anecdotally, I'd say 80% of the time worked on the 1st try, 15% on the 2nd, and 5% of the time one of us would have to open the app on our phone first and then try. Now with version 2019.32.12.2, we have to open our phone app *every time*.

The fobs are a different story. I'll call them Fob A thru D.

Fob A works as you expect each. and. every. time.

Fob B works every time to open the doors, but never to start the car. I have to either put the fob on the center console or push one of the buttons on the fob. Sometimes shaking or touching the fob helps, but only sometimes.

Fob C does not work right. You have to push a button to open the doors. Pushing the trunk or frunk button will allow the doors to be opened; I'm not sure if the proximity sensor is working or if the fobs without the sensor work the same way. It never hassles me about driving.

Fob D works unreliably. Seems to be 50/50. Regardless of whether it works or not, it never hassles me about starting the car.

And when I say any of them ""don't work"", I mean on the 1st try or the 10th try... I usually have to push the button on the fob (but sometimes shaking it or touching it seems to work.)

Strangely, for all fobs AND phones: auto locking when walking away ALWAYS works.

We'll often go out with one phone (that's usually powered off) and/or fob. I'd say about half the times the fobs weren't working we didn't have a phone with us. Which is interesting because it means 50% of the time the fobs weren't working, the phones weren't, either.

When we tried any two fobs together, they ALWAYS worked.

Side question for anyone who got this far: I can pair key cards with driver profiles, but it won't let me assign them to fobs. Why?",teslamotors,1572477963,DenseGeologist,18,9,True,2019-10-30

Some of you may have seen my Tweet where on my vacation home to NY I got 4 referrals for Model 3's by letting others drive my car. I was even attacked by some TeslaQ idiot saying I was lying (I was not even exaggerating how many in fact) - well one of those was my Grammy who is a firecracker from Brooklyn and loves technology. She fell in love with my Model 3 and ordered one of her own. Only days later she was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung, esophagus, and lymph cancer.

When we ordered, it showed a delivery time of two weeks, and as many of you saw, those times this quarter quickly slipped to 6-10 weeks. Hers was one of those and well, right now every day is a gift. We stayed in communication with her delivery specialist who was very kind and tried everything to find her the one she wanted sooner (White on White Long Range Dual Motor). Finally today we saw she got a Delivery date at the Charlotte store (the nearest one to the house she has chosen to spend retirement in as of a year ago). I was as excited for her as she was! My grandpa even worked with the electrician to have her outlet installed so she can charge it as soon as it arrives. My father, her son (another one of those referrals from my trip) has been answering her questions as he learns new things about his own car. It's been a group effort. 

One of the people I had been chatting with to help get her car, reached out to the Manager at the Charlotte store and she called me. She was so incredibly sweet, and when I asked if they do home delivery (which is apparently too far from the store typically) the manager said: ""Even if I need to myself, we will deliver the car to her - we would be honored to help in any way we can"". I started to cry a bit. 

Here's a company I've loved for years, got a half dozen referrals for - just to help the company thrive in my mind, and they gave me the best thank you that I could have ever gotten by treating my Grandma so well. You've made my whole family cry today Tesla, for the best reason we've had in months. Thank you, to the entire team that has pulled this together. I'm a fan and customer for life.

Additionally, if you want white it's free now so would be worth switching in that case too.

I'm not sure if it'll impact the delivery date or not, so just be aware. I decided to take the risk

242,Range mode + Ludicrous Plus? (Taycan v. MS),"Hi Reddit! 

I'm a former Tesla employee and life long performance guy turned Tesla owner/enthusiast after years of launching Ludicrous+.  My job included managing a local showroom fleet - from quality control to vehicle dynamics, I spent the majority of my time driving and demonstrating Teslas of all trims. Of course, the MS P100DL was my favorite and likely driven more than the rest. Hosting demos to win over Porsche, Lamborghini, Mercedes-AMG, BMW M, etc. owners compelled me to always make sure a P100DL was running as close to peak as possible (SOC, pack temp, settings.)

As such, I recall times when attempting to enable Ludicrous+ would fail. The car would go through its warp screen, bring up the Performance readout and a few seconds later would turn off. Ultimately **it turned itself off due to range mode being enabled** in order to deny the expenditure of power for such frivolous purposes (as it should!)

**Can any P100DL owners out there confirm this to still be true?** If this in fact is still the case, this supports the theory that without Ludicrous+ enabled, the battery was not pre-conditioned and launch control was not able to be used.

My vote is for Dragtimes to test the two cars!


TL;DR: Does range mode still override Ludicrous Plus and turn the setting off after 5-10 seconds? This was a detail I noticed during my employment there and would show Top Gear ran the MS wrong.",teslamotors,1572576675,Stickyv35,0,1,True,2019-10-31
243,Enhanced Auto Pilot HELP!!,"I just purchased a 2018 Model S from a 3rd party dealership, and am having the most fun I’ve ever had driving!  I was originally looking at a new Model 3, but I found a really good deal on a low mileage, year old Model S with Enhanced Auto Pilot enables so I went that route instead, and couldn’t be happier!

This is where the plot thickens.  Just today, they (Tesla support) transferred the car to my Tesla account so I could use the Tesla App, and manage the car on my account.  When I login to my account, I checked to see if possibly FSD was originally purchased with the car as well (as the dealership didn’t even realize the car has EAP, score!!). But when I look at the upgrade options, I see both FSD ($6000) and Autopilot ($3000) as upgrade options.  But I know the car has EAP, as I am able to smart summon, navigate on autopilot, and have all the options shown in my settings menu.  Is it possible I have a trial version of EAP?  I don’t see any notification that says “x days left” or anything like that.  But I would think, if I have a purchased version of EAP, then the only upgrade option on the website would be FSD, which is not the case.

I was originally planning to do a factory reset once I got the car attached to my account, but now I’m scared to because I’m afraid I will lose EAP.  I’m also hesitant to reach out to Tesla support as I don’t want to alert them to a mistake, if it was accidentally enabled.

**A fairly simple task would be that upon detection of a garbage truck or dump truck in your area, turn on air recirculation until 1 minute after the last detection.**

309,Tesla should have options to donate trees as a referral award and during the ordering process,"Elon donates 1,000,000 trees which is fantastic and I applaud anyone willing to do something like that. However, the 20,000,000 tree campaign is a one time thing and the world needs many more than that. 

 I’d love it if Tesla let people opt to donate some number of trees as a referral award in lieu of supercharger credits. For some reason the price for the trees was $1 per tree when I’ve seen non-profits plant trees for 10 cents. It may be possible to donate something on the order of 100-1000 trees if they are 10 cents each instead of receiving 1000 supercharger miles. I’m sure many people would be happy to do so.

Also, it would be great if we could donate trees during the ordering process or immediately after. Some people may want to do so in order to help offset the carbon in producing their Tesla vehicle or energy products. They could have some default numbers but also allow you to type in whatever number you want. The additional money looks very small during a large purchase and people are trying to be environmentally conscious when making their purchase. 

I think if Tesla did both those things many millions of trees would be donated annually. Especially if they were being planted for 10 cents instead of $1 each. 

Perhaps Elon could even throw a little bit of engineering resources at how to plant trees more efficiently and effectively as a goodwill project. I’ve seen things like tree planting drones. There was a recent study that said planting 1.2 trillion new trees could sequester the last 10 years of total carbon dioxide emissions.  Clearly there could be massive benefits to throwing some effort at this. Plus trees can help beautify many areas and protect wildlife.

I hit the button on the cord, pulled out the charger, stretched out the cord, and tried again. Same-same, except as I was pushing in the charger, the port cover started to automatically descend. I plugged it in as the port cover hit the top of my charger. It went back up. 

Again, it didn't feel right, and I don't think I got the Good Connection light, so I pulled out the cord and repositioned the car. 

Now when I plug in the charger, I get a blinking yellow light, and there's a click-click sound I think from the charge lock. It's like the lock can't engage for some reason. There's a little warning chime from inside the car, but nothing comes up on the screen. 

After maybe ten click-click sounds, it gives up, but the light stays blinking yellow. The screen in the car indicates that the car is charging.

378,Vibration noise from dashboard,"Hello folks,

My 2019 M3 (manufactured July) has an intermittent vibration coming from the dashboard on the driver's side, as far as I can tell. It sounds like this:
https://youtu.be/hQttUptfytI
(apologies for the poor quality)

I previously took the vehicle in for service and this was the report:
""Technician verified customer concern. Upon inspection found upper air vent on driver side making intermittent contact with 
underside of dash pad insulated as best as possible and test drove under the same conditions used to verify concern and 
vibration no longer present.""

Whatever the tech did, it may have helped some (the problem seemed to go away for a few weeks) but it's creeping back again (as can be heard in that video).
I feel like the way they ""fixed"" this was a patch to begin with, so I can't say I'm surprised. Something about the assembly of my dash seems bad and it's weird to me they need to make post factory modifications to address it.

Just wanted to get your folks' take on this. If anyone had a similar problem and can provide guidance that would be great. 
The annoying thing is this is an intermittent issue so it's hard to catch. Got another service appointment coming up but honestly not expect anything at this point. This would be the 3rd attempt at repairing this.",teslamotors,1572680121,dandandanny,39,12,True,2019-11-02

396,Why would someone think this was ok? PHL airport,"I'll preface it by saying I wish I took a picture but I did not.

Had a business trip this week. Had to fly out for about 2 days. Got to the airport around 5am (phl). Noticed on chargepoint app that there was an open charger in the D terminal. I was flying out of D as well.  Perfect. Chargers are ""free"" as well. I say ""free"" because parking is $24 / day. Economy is $11 / day but I had a 55lb luggage I had to check. I didn't feel like lugging it on the shuttle bus. 

Anyway let's not debate the wisdom of having chargers in an airport parking lot. It's not the smartest thing since they could be sitting there with a fully charged car for a few days until you return from your trip. A large bank of level 1 chargers would be much better imo. 

I have a 17 volt. Saw the open charger and plugged in. I came back about 36 hours later and found a note under my wiper. It said "" don't park here if you're aren't fully electric ""insulting term"""".  At this point there were two open chargers. There was a model 3 next to me and a model s parked down at the end of the same row. I'm not saying it was a Tesla owner who left a note. It must have been someone who has an ev tho. So is anyone here willing to fess up? Feel free to pm me.

399,Tesla - skeezy business practices or bait and switch?,"Several members of my extended family drive Tesla cars and only speak its praises, and when I test drove one of their model 3s I realized I wanted one as well, if my financial situation could accommodate one.  The software updates, the self driving capabilities, no need to waste time filling up gas and also being environmentally friendly? Count me in.  

I recently changed jobs that required me to relocate across the country to Maryland, so the pay bump and my desire for a sweet car tipped me to finally order one online last month.  I picked out my color Midnight Silver and the Long-Range dual motor option and paid the deposit.  I got a call from Tesla representative Michael that confirmed I could pick it up on October 31.  I get a VIN for insurance, everything seemed set.

Two weeks ago I noticed they had written the pickup date as October 22, a week before I would even be in Maryland, so I called Tesla rep Michael and he confirmed the date would be changed to the date we agreed on earlier.

Then October 30th rolls around and right as I fly into Maryland I get a call from Tesla Michael, telling me my car has been sold to someone else.  Obviously shocked, I asked what could be done, and he mentioned I should call the Rockville Tesla Sales Center Brian to get things sorted out.  I called them all day without ever getting an answer from them, and finally got an email from Brian curtly telling me to talk to Michael for other options.

The next day Michael emails me apologizing and promising me that I can get a loaner vehicle in the meantime from Brian.  However shortly afterwards another curt email from Brian stated ""we do not have loaners to just give out for long periods of time due to delays from the factory."" But this was not due to a delay from the factory, this was due to them selling my car (which I already had a VIN for and set up insurance) out from under me!  

I called Michael and he told me that unfortunately it will take 6-8 weeks to get a new car from the factory.  I obviously need a car for to drive to my new job and cannot wait that long.  However there is a Tesla available in Alabama that can be shipped here in 8 days.  I have to pay an extra 2500 since it is a performance model, although it's lacking performance wheels and spoiler and should look the same as a regular model 3.  So it's either wait 6-8 weeks, or pay an extra 2500 dollars for a ""performance"" car that looks the same as a regular model 3?  And I still have to rent a car and wait 8 days until I get it, if I get it?

They mentioned I could get $500 worth at the Tesla store, although there's nothing there that I want (it doesn't include supercharging).

So I need to rent a car and pay $2500 extra for a car I already had.  The fact that Tesla screwed up and caused a lot of trouble for me, and yet doesn't seem to be willing to be accommodating at all seems troubling.  Especially since I have to pay an additional 2500 for an upgrade i didn't want for a car that looks the same? Is this a bait and switch?

406,"Bought a used model S from tesla, range seems much lower than expected.","Hey guys, i just picked up a used model S 2015 70D from tesla in Vancouver. It has 80k KM (50k miles).

I asked it to charge to 100% overnight and it's only coming up with 333km instead of 386km -- 85% of the 'rated' charge. I expected a 4-6% degradation, but 15% seems like a lot.

It also seems to drop pretty fast as i start driving.

Not sure if it's battery related or just because it's a bit colder outside right now (~8-9 C during the day and 0-1 C during the night).

Having 0 experience with a tesla, does the reported range drop when it's cold, or is the battery degraded by 15%. They assured me the vehicle was inspected and with warranty when i got it and never gave me ""how degraded is the battery"" percent before buying it.

420,NEMA 6-20 vs. Wall Connector vs. SolarEdge,"I’m on the list for a model Y and want to get a charging set up into my garage. Based on my breaker box, it appears that I already have a 240V 20A circuit in the garage (previous owner was into woodworking). So I was just thinking I could have a NEMA 6-20 outlet installed and get a second mobile connector to permanently use from that outlet. The charging speed provided by that outlet should be more than adequate for my needs.

What would be the benefit of installing a Wall Connector instead? I think that would require more significant changes to my current wiring setup if I wanted to use more amps. I don’t think I need more than 20 amps and I’m not sure my current breaker box has that much spare capacity.

Also, I’m getting some solar panels installed, and the contractor suggested they could install a SolarEdge EV Charger Level 2. I’m not sure what the benefit of that over a Wall Connector would be.

For instance, when do the batteries need to be replaced and how much will that cost? Is there any known issues (hardware or electronic) with used Teslas, particularly older models like 2016, 2017? What is the upkeep cost, if any? 

I hear a lot of great things about Teslas but hoping to get some honest answers from long time owners and used Tesla buyers. Thanks a ton!",teslamotors,1572721896,bigjamg,0,1,True,2019-11-02
424,Renting out Model 3 on Turo?,"Hi all. 

I've been looking (obsessing?) about getting a Model 3 for years now. It's within budget, but unfortunately I have another year left on my current car lease. 

I've been exploring the option of buying a Model 3 through a business, and renting it out on Turo. The numbers look decent (\~$200/day rental rates). So, 10 days of rentals a month might actually generate some cashflow.

430,Tesla Insurance Clarifying Questions,"Hi all,

We are looking into getting a Model 3 SR+ (no FSD), and as we were running down the list of costs, Insurance came up. Traditionally, insurance has been pretty high, especially because we have a teenager driving. Current car is a Chevy Bolt '17, and rates are waayyy up there. Never had a crash/accident (knock on wood), and have a clean driving history (1 ticket 5 years ago). Live in SoCal, three drivers including one teen.

After hearing about Tesla Insurance, and that it is cheaper than Geico, I had some coverage-related questions. I can't get a quote until I buy the car, so here we go: 

Firstly, what is the actual coverage? I've looked around a bit and have found the deductible to be $500 and the total liability to be $100,000. Is this correct? Does it vary? What other packages are offered? 

Second, have there been any issues in auto-pay? I have seen some people saying that the payment dodn't go through (or something like that). Is this fixed? 

Third, if someone has any sort of relation to my situation, is there any way you can give me an estimate on insurance price?

Finally, how much of the actual ""customizing"" or changing of info can you do online vs. calling in?

The call center I was directed to said that they can't quote me until I have a reservation or deposit for a car. Sorry if this seems redundant!

Right now, if you want a smoother ride, you have to buy an S, or X. This of course just makes problem #1 even worse. Elon has said that the S and X are now more niche products, that Tesla is selling for sentimental reasons. But what about selling cars that might appeal to a more broad audience? Ones that aren’t tuned for the more sporty types. We want a car that’s comfortable on a long drive. One where you can lay your head back on the headrest and not feel every bump in the road. I’m not talking anything dramatic. My wife drives a Corolla. So just something a little more “normal.” Are there any plans for this to happen?

458,How we can get the share price of Tesla to where it should be and help Elon secure funding for his many endeavors,"tl;dr at the bottom

As we all know, Tesla does no longer receive a significant federal tax credit on sales. Manufacturers like VW, Audi, Toyota etc. who not only gave all the burden and risk of pioneering electric vehicles to a startup, but also cheated on emissions regulations with the full knowledge of upper management, still reiceive 7,500$ per sale (technically it goes to the buyer, but you know what I am trying to say). Go figure, the playing field is no longer level and fair in the US, Tesla’s biggest market.

We need an EV tax credit which is not limited by the amount of sales, as well as a carbon tax, to accelerate the transition to a sustainable future. 

How can we make sure this will be implemented?

Next year there is going to be a presidential election, which will decide the future of US policies concerning climate change. 

Elon tweeted „I support Yang“ (democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang).

Andrew Yang is not only very tech savy, but also strongly in favor of exploring all ways to fight the climate crisis we all will have to face. He is definitely pro tax credit and also proposes a carbon tax on his policy page. This would help secure the funding for the future endeavors of Tesla, SpaceX and all the other exciting enterprises Elon will come up with. 

tl;dr: Please upvote and comment on this post, so Elon sees it and does another JRE with presidential candidate Andrew Yang. Yang is the best candidate to help Tesla and therefore Elon.

PS: Elon, if you have a chance to take some time out of your busy schedule and spill exclusive info about the Pickup truck/Model Y/Starship during a JRE with Andrew Yang, it could help Tesla immensely. I know it is a long term play, but so is everything else you do. Stay positive, you inspire all of us!",teslamotors,1572753604,todoesposible95,11,0,True,2019-11-03

473,Questions before buying Model S (UK),"Hi All,

I took a test drive 2 weeks ago and I am sold, granted I drove a 2019 model but I was really impressed with everything about the car, the fact I can charge at home and not have to worry about buying diesel ever again. The ride was smooth and I love gadgets most of all plus I love anything smart from lights to vacuum to mower etc. Having driven both the Model 3 and the Model 3, I am still in favour of the S coming from a BMW 5 series I prefer the bigger and wider car to the smaller Model 3 etc. I wasn't planning on buying a brand new Model S due to depreciation in the first 3 years although it seems the Model 3 might hold its value better even after 3 years etc. 

So I am looking to buy from Tesla's used inventory , I placed an order for a blue 2015 model S with 35K on the clock. I have not done anything further than paying the initial deposit, I was expecting actual photos of the car as I requested one in an email  but I haven't received anything yet from Tesla, I understand I will only get to see the Car on the pick date, 

Can anyone with better knowledge tell me what those details actually means, what can the **Autopilot with convenience features** means?

If it helps car was **originally registered on 1st September 2015**

 Specs

* 5.2 sec 0-60 mph
* 140 mph Top Speed
* **292 mi range (WLTP)** what does this mean in real life driving?
* **70D** What is the battery capacity?
* All-Wheel Drive
* Deep Blue Metallic Paint
* Sunroof
* 19"" Wheels
* Multi-Pattern Black Seats
* Piano Black Décor
* Standard Headliner
* **Autopilot with convenience features**
* **Autopilot with convenience features**
* No - 19"" Wheels with Nokian Winter Tyres

 Warranty

* 2 year, 100,000 miles limited warranty
* 3 year, infinite miles battery and drive warranty

I would love the summon and autopilot features , also will the car have the 360 camera so it can record videos of its surroundings when its parked unattended?

Only reason I am buying from Tesla is because of warranty, if I find a private sale with Tesla's warranty left, is that a bad idea?

Can Tesla extend this 2/3 year warranty if I wanted?, any idea of potential cost of this or not worth buying an extended warranty. I am slightly worried once the car is out of warranty and been an electric car, it might be impossible to get repairs done anywhere else but at Tesla, are there any experiences with people owning Teslas that are how of warranty and what are the issues they have encountered etc, repair cost etc. 

Will this also come with the sim card to connect to Tesla's network etc.

497,Tesla autopilot prevents accident with coyote,"[https://youtu.be/VE2sKm0JYH4](https://youtu.be/VE2sKm0JYH4) 

Fall is here and we decided to take advantage of the gorgeous weather and take a day trip to nearby Louisville, Kentucky.

After an amazing day of exploring the city, (and even getting free charging in one of the parking garages) it was around 8:30 pm and dark; it time to head back home. We entered our home address into the navigation and hopped on I-71N and began the roughly 90 minute drive home.  At about the halfway mark, on a very dark section of 71-north, without warning, a coyote suddenly decided to try and cross the highway. The creature and I locked eyes and I braced for what I thought would be an inevitable accident. Mind you, this all happened within 1-2 seconds.   

Luckily for my family, Tesla Autopilot was able to see the coyote, swerve the car to miss it, and correctly put us right back into our lane. Again, this all happened in the matter of mere seconds. The car reacted before I could and anticipated the correct course of action. Because of Tesla, my family wasn't involved in an accident on the expressway on a dark, cold fall night.

What a moment. What a car! In addition to the safety features, I've traveled over 11,000 miles in almost 5 months of ownership and the car continues to amaze me. Thank you to the team at Tesla for creating the most advanced and safest car you can drive on the planet.

71,Sweet Solvent/Chemical Smell from AC (NOT mold/mildew related),"So I have had my M3 to the dealer twice to try and get rid of a fairly often occurring ""sweet"" solvent/chemical smell.  I don't know exactly what ethylene-glycol smells like, but my guess is this might be it.  This is NOT the mildew/mold/dirty sock smell people have had lots of issues with.

I've had my car since April this year (new with 17 miles) and it is a 2018 built in Sept. last year.  It sat on a lot for many months before I purchased it.  I've smelled this odor occasionally when I first got the car but I honeslty thought the smell was coming from outside in the environment, like a local chemical plant.  Recently the chemical odor seems to be getting stronger and staying for longer.  The smell goes away when I put the car on recirculate.  It only happens when pulling in fresh air with the AC.

My first trip to the SC resulted in them doing the standard AC condenser clean out and new filters... which did nothing for this smell.  I just got back from my second trip today.  They kept it over a day or two and said they had 6 people, including the service manager and head techs get in the car with full AC on, both inside the shop and outside when it got hot.  No one could smell any odors emanating from the vents.  They also did a thermal check on the AC (which, from what I understand, just checks the temp of the air coming from the vents) and visually checked for a leak.  They said they can't reproduce the smell and the AC should be fine since it's cold air and they don't see any leaks.

While driving back with my family (I live 2.5  hours away from this particular SC), the smell came back after a brief rainstorm on the interstate... it was VERY strong this time.  My wife smelled it and my boys smelled it, so at least I know I'm not crazy or severely sensitive to smells.  I really don't want to be breathing this in since I'm not sure what it is and it can be nauseating after 10-20 minutes.  Turning on recirculate always makes it go away, but I don't think I should have to do that every time I start to smell it.

I'm probably going to try a different SC next that has a much larger volume of business.  Has anyone experienced anything remotely like this and were you able to find a remedy?  I'm getting desperate to get rid of this odor!",teslamotors,1569805855,Zarlov,31,8,True,2019-09-29
75,ExactAir vs. Tesla Dashboard,"So Tesla shows my Model 3 tires were below the recommended 42 psi. It starts sending critical warnings (yellow) below 38 psi. I drive in arid and desert climate so fast temperature changes (as much as a 40F drop at night) can cause the dashboard to freak out. 

I went to a gas station that had an ExactAir (love these). I set the tire pressure at 42. Two tires were already at 42. The other two got there.

Upon driving my dashboard shows 40 psi for the front wheels and 39 psi for the back.

108,My tesla experience so far,"I gotta be honest and explain my experience so far trying to buy a Tesla.

My current situation: Trading in my car that has been somewhat reliable considering its a dodge and since I can afford it, I want to get a car that will last. I bought the dodge new(have had horrible luck with used) but given the resale value and just everything Tesla offers its a relatively no brainer.

Experience: go onto Tesla site and schedule a test drive a couple weeks ago. Get a text from someone at Tesla, and a voice mail from 2 others within about 8 hours. Schedule with the last one, as I replied to the text and got no response.

Test drove on the weekend, got some generic 'quotes', explained that I would like to purchase in the very near future, within a week or two. Given they have a promotion on supercharging that ends on the 1st, I have to make a decision quickly. Couple days after the weekend, asking all sorts of buying questions, can you run my credit, if I have to have my car built and it won't be delivered until after the 1st do I miss my promo, etc... Not a response. Ghosted at this point. I give the rep, the one I test drove with, a full day to respond, then I call that location to work with his sup.  All while my desired build that was in existing inventory gets sold

In the meantime, I've secured financing since I wasn't getting a response with Tesla, and probably ended with a much better rate anyways.

Try to use credit card for the initial 2.5k payment. Shit don't work, their site doesn't want it. Called my card issuer, no problem on my end.

Couple hours later, problem fixed, card charged, car 'secured'. I'm thinking I'm home free....

NOPE!

Lender needs signed agreement to send their payment (which I guess is a check overnight) and Tesla only exists in the future for their cars and not with documents so they don't use docusign pre-delivery and since everything else seems to be a priority except for me buying this car they let me know of this issue a full 30 minutes before the lender closes for the weekend.

So I have to upload the doc, hope the lender will take the docusign so they can overnight the check so I can pick up tomorrow, only to re-read the delivery team email I get on a Saturday evening which reads that another person sent it straight to Tesla HQ(exactly how the site reads) and that they want it at their location.

I thought buying a car at a dealership was a horrible experience. Christ, I'll sit a table a few hours and at least I know the outcome, the people I've worked out have absolutely no fucking clue what is going on. 

TLDR: If this was any other car, I would've gone elsewhere and I don't have any idea despite securing financing or my down payment that I'll collect my car in 12 hours.",teslamotors,1569819068,Kr1sys,23,10,True,2019-09-30

130,MX Charging Pulse Issue,"So about 2 weeks ago I received my MX 2019 Raven -- thus far no issues have been encountered. About 2 days ago I received the version 10.0 update and as usual, I updated overnight --- the day after when coming back from work - my battery was down to 50 miles remaining and I plugged it in once reaching my home. For the first five minutes -- the green pulse was present in the charging port as I was doing other work in my garage -- before heading in - i noticed that the pulse was gone however the tesla wall charger unit on the wall was still draining power -- so I checked the app and on there it still showed that the car was charging at 41miles/hr @ 48/48A -- the power unit in my electrical panel is rated for 60A -- I also checked the dash in car and it was showing that the car is charging --- so what's going on with the pulse and why isnt it there?   I also get no green pulse when i connect to a supercharger but the car still charges fine. 

This has happened since i updated to version 10.0 -- never had an issue before -- see video clip:  https://imgur.com/mLvW6MT

131,20 miles per day phantom drain. What the hell.,"I parked at a covered parking place at the airport in Houston on Friday with an M3 SR+ at 190 miles. I turned off sentry mode but left cabin overheat on, figuring I wouldn’t need it with covered parking but just in case. I checked a couple of times Saturday and the inside temperature never really got above the low 90s but the battery was steadily draining. By Sunday morning, it was at 150 miles so I changed my password just in case there were API calls banging on it then force quit my phone app and never touched it again. This morning it’s at 130 miles. 

So I don’t get back into town until Saturday. At this rate I should hit 20% around Friday so I’m hoping at that point it goes into low power mode until I get back, but is there anything else I can try in the meantime to stop the drain?",teslamotors,1569849571,mclarty,43,0,True,2019-09-30

First time: driving on a normal 2 lane road. Not the highway as AP is suggested for, but I've driven this road once a week at least since buying the car, AP has never had a problem. On a straight road, clear skies, no other cars, AP alarms and turns itself off. Not a safety issue as my hands are on the wheel, but AP pretty much never quits on me, so it was weird.

Second time: 100% suggested use of autopilot: using NoA, coming up to an exit, the car seems it's going to miss but it aggressively goes for the exit a bit late. Nbd as it makes the exit and is centered nicely in the lane. Then suddenly AP alarms and shuts off.... Again, hands are on the wheel, but I take this exit omw to work all the time.

136,Old Navigation Interface w/ Current Software?,[removed],teslamotors,1569850605,bemental_,0,1,True,2019-09-30
138,"Old Navigation Interface, Current Software","Traded in our 2014 S on Friday for a late 2016 with AP 1 hardware. 

Super happy with the vehicle, noticed something odd with the vehicle’s navigation. 

If I’m not mistaken, this vehicle is still running the old style navigation displays, with the old style arrow icon, the same buggy “lag-behind” route following (where the arrow hovers over the red route line, and then after a second or two the line catches up and cuts out), as well as the old-style “pictures” to show exits from the interstate, with the name of the exit superimposed over the image. 

Vehicle is running 2019.32.2.2 da05838, which I believe is the most current version most AP1 models have at this time. 

I realize that the navigation package is separate, and only updates via WiFi - but I figured that even if the previous owner didn’t have WiFi where the vehicle was parked, that with it being at the service center for a week and a half before delivery, it would have updated the maps since then. 

Any ideas on how to get the navigation updates other than “waiting it out” on home WiFi? 

Or is this perhaps the norm for AP1 vehicles and I’m just unaware of it. Our trade in pre-AP vehicle definitely had the updated maps package, so I expected this vehicle to as well. 


Thanks for the suggestions!

145,Pull the trigger before end of quarter?,"I know this is all speculation, but would love to hear thoughts on pulling the trigger on a model 3 to take advantage of the free supercharging for 2 years offer they have.  Not sure if I should hold off on anything better for the end of the year or even hold off until first quarter of 2020 to see if there are additional price drops.  I know I'd be missing out on the tax incentive though.

This has been suuuuch a hard decision.  The only reason I'm holding off on a model 3 is because it kills me to take the new car deprecation hit.

Granted I'd probably sell the CPO after 3 years or so when the warranty is up, while I'd keep the Tesla for much longer.

150,Smart Summon Question?,"Okay, we’ve all seen how smart summon works, some of us have been posting videos. I’ve used it, it’s unbelievable, but I have a couple questions.

Backstory: I wanted to use the smart summon feature at the grocery store. I hesitated, and ultimately chose not to use it, because the parking lot was designed for one way lanes with angled parking spots. I haven’t dove into the logic behind smart summon, but I assume it finds the shortest path between the car and the user and avoids object the car sees. 

Questions: does smart summon recognize the one way in the parking lot? Would it pull itself out of the spot drive down the parking lot, go to the next lane to come back up to the user? Will it just try to pull out, and ultimately go the wrong direction?

TL;DR: how does smart summon handle one way parking lots with angled parking spots?",teslamotors,1569855417,Poorman1700,0,1,True,2019-09-30
154,A Few Issues with Spotify -,"Super nice having Spotify in the car now. But I notice that sometimes the music won’t actually play. It will show a “losing circle” over the play butting, and the current time of the music (say if you’re 20 seconds into a 3 minute song) will display and progress, but it will not play music. I’ve also noticed that sometimes songs in a playlist will not auto-play the subsequent song. Instead, it will stop after the current song or repeat the current song if you have repeat set to on. Both of these seem to be fixed by resetting the MCU, but it’s not really worth using it given how often I would need to be resetting the MCU.

There are several used Model Ss in my area with less than 100k miles that are selling between $34 and $38k. I pay about 6 cents per kWh and gas averages about $2.50. I’m comparing such a used Tesla to a used (2012-2016) Honda Accord and it is definitely compelling.

1) What repair/maintenance costs can i expect over the next 5-8 years?

2) What might the 2013 Tesla be worth in 5-8 years? 

3) What range of insurance costs can i expect? (29 yr old male, no accidents, high credit, homeowner, steady 6 figure job)

159,PSA: With Smart Summon be careful if starting from grass,"I've had really good results with smart summon on pavement.  But I've now tested it quite a bit starting from grass in 2 different locations.  One place is at my cousin's house in a more rural area.  He has a gravel driveway and most park off to the side in the grass.  The second place is at my work where I park in the back of the building.  The building's owners have let the rock parking area get overgrown with grass.  

In both areas it goes pretty crazy and just randomly backs up and goes forward in directions which make no sense and most of the time is completely inconsistent (if you try again from the same starting spot.)  This is the same whether I use the 'come to me' button or the smart summon where you drop a target.  

The worrisome part?  When testing at my cousin's house it turned completely away from where it was supposed to go and went full speed (5mph) towards a big tree.  It scared me so I let off the button.  I was pretty worried that it would have hit the tree but I wasn't sure.  When just testing at my work it was going all over the place and a couple times it seemed like it was going to hit the pole barriers around 3/4 of the parking area.  Then one time it did the same as the tree incident.  It started fast and headed towards one of the (metal pole) barriers.  I let off of the button and it actually delayed a half second or so before it even started to stop and it stopped inches away from the pole.  I'm sure this time it would have hit it.  

I'm letting you guys know because I truly thought it wouldn't hit anything just based on the ultrasonic sensors but apparently it may.  It just seems to lose it's mind when its on grass.  The odd thing is a couple of times at my cousin's house it started perfectly from the grass, backed onto the gravel driveway and then drove perfectly straight to me.",teslamotors,1569859239,scotchy180,26,70,True,2019-09-30
160,How much would you pay for a Tesla?,"Hey guys, 
so I'm a long time fan of these cars (it's almost an obsession to be honest).

I love the look, the simplicity, the sound, the silence, the efficiency, the doorhandels, the sentry mode, the no key thingy, yada yada yada.. most of you understand I guess.

My only problem my other hobby. Investing.

I am torn apart between the most awesome car to date, and 57,000€  (performance without fsd) and the compound interest I could get from that.

I see so many people pulling the trigger here, young people, happy people and I wanted to ask the already owners how much of your spendable money (monthly income after taxes) do you spend on this awesome car.
Or what would you be willing to spend.


I would need to spend 25% of my income and it seems sooo much. 

I never owned a new car, never even paid over 9k for one. And now I'm seriously playing with the idea of buying this really expensive thing. 

I feel like I need to put things into perspective and that's why I would love to know how much % you (would) pay for this dream car.

    sun_roof_percent_open     : 
    sun_roof_state            : unknown

The new defrost_mode changes from 0 to 2 when enabled in the app and 2 to 0 when disabled.  Initial power draw on max defrost is between 6.5-6.7 kW (with the driver seat heater on low) and the ""max"" temperature setting corresponds to 28°C.  The full list of API changes caused by enabling max defrost on my car is as follows:

    9/30/2019 12:15:05 PM  Roadrunner.climate_state.defrost_mode changed from 0 to 2
    9/30/2019 12:15:05 PM  Roadrunner.climate_state.driver_temp_setting changed from 22.0 to 28.0

    9/30/2019 12:15:10 PM  Roadrunner.climate_state.is_auto_conditioning_on changed from False to True
    9/30/2019 12:15:25 PM  Roadrunner.charge_state.charger_phases changed from  to 1

**homelink_device_count** has been added, but I'm unsure what context it's used for within the Tesla app at this time. 

The new window states appear to be 0 if closed, 1 if vented, and 2 if partially or fully opened.  Annoyingly, the naming convention of the windows (fd_, fp_, rd_, rp_) is inconsistent with the door/trunk states (df, dr, pf, pr, ft, rt).

The new software_update states **download_perc** and **install_perc** appear to be integers from 0-100 representing progress.  **version** is likely the next version to be updated to.

Interestingly, looking back through my change log I spotted a couple of other transient or vestigial API changes in previous versions that went unnoticed until now.  The car reports a wiper blade heater turning on along with side mirror heaters when rear defrost is enabled, despite no wiper heater being present in the Model 3:

212,My buying experience is a never-ending nightmare.,"So I pulled the trigger and bought a Model 3. The customer experience has been a nightmare so far. Let me tell you my story.

I drop by the Tesla dealership. Talk to a friendly guy, gives me info and hooks me up for a test ride. I’ll fast forward, and after an overnight, to see if it fits my garage, I decide I want it.

I want a specific “build”. A “stealth” Model 3. All the zoomies, but no carbon wing, red calipers or lowered height.

So I’m on the phone with that friendly guy, and he finds me one. It’s blue, but I don’t care. I can get it wrapped anyway. So I go for it. I pay the advance, and it gets linked to my account.

He tells me I’ll get a call to arrange delivery. Which I get. But I’m in a meeting, so I call back. Yet another friendly person picks up.

After going back and forth a bit, I feel somethings off. I ask him directly and his response is as following. “The car you purchased mistakingly showed up in the system. It’s not available anymore”

Ah, shoot. But, sh*t happens, and I’m not a difficult person, so we go over other options. He finds another one. A grey one! With nicer rims! I’m a bit happy, because I like that more. He even gives me a deal on the rims and color, because they made an error.

Days go by. I don’t see the grey one pop up in my app, so I get a bit worried. Gues I’ll give them a call.

The friendly person picks up. Again, bit back and forth, and I feel he’s dragging. I ask about it, and he goes: That car is not available anymore.

I’m getting annoyed. I don’t want to yell at him, so I hung up. I immediatly call the first person, whom I had seen in real life, to explain the situation.

He is flabbergasted. “How could this have happend”. We immediatly find a replacement, a black one, but I now have to pay more, for less options. I try to pull some benefits out of this ordeal, but to no avail. I’m at the point of cancelling the whole operation, because I’ve been sinking too much time into this.

I ran to the bank twice already, and the insurance company twice too. I had to tell them they’d have to do it all over again for a third time.

But I’ve got my mind set on it. So I push through. I’d be getting a black Model 3, with nice rims and a Performance upgrade. I want it.

Fast forward to delivery. I show up a tad early. No problem, I can work mobile. Eventually I get to see the car. After 1.5 hours.

It’s not charged 100%, only 50%. It’s been cleaned in a rush. White residue all over the place from the protective stickers.

I inspect the car further. A lot of dings and scratches catch my eye. The bottom’s damaged, the front lip too. It clearly scraped. Small scuffs here and there.

The salesperson takes pictures and assures me it’ll get fixed. Tesla Service will contact me for an appointment.

So I drive my newly aqcuired car to work. After 20 km’s, I get a  notification. Wheel pressure is off on all 4 wheels. It jumps to 1 wheel, back to 4, to go to 2 wheels.

This happens, especially with new tires. You just have to record the new pressure in the system. Which I did. To no avail. I carry on driving.

I hit the highway. Clean straight driving. And I notice something else. The steeringwheel’s not straight. It sits at a tiny angle. I do some more tests and yes, when holding the whee straight, the car pulls left. That’s not aligned well.

I arrive at my work’s parking lot. I put it in reverse. The camera pops up, but I hear no sounds. Weird. I also notice I’m not getting distance readings on my screen. I quickly look up the issue of not having parking sensors, and after a reset... still nothing.

God, I really want to like this car.

Now I ended with my “third” Tesla, scuffed and scratched, dirty as hell, no parking sensores, a plethora of warnings and an angled steeringwheel.

229,Here is Model 3 SR+ summary Read before you buy," 

Hello everyone, so I currently own Porsche Cayenne and Hyundai Sonata-

Porsche is my date night/events car, or if I want to enjoy some good sound while riding in style- occasionally drive it to work on Friday's. Hyundai, I use this for grocery shopping, driving to work and ride share. Had to talk to the wife and show her cost/benefit analysis of switching to electric- we are both young (early 30's) so accepting and adapting to changes in the technological age is not a hard sell to us. She wants the X because we have a 7- seater ICE car for now.

1. If you really want a Tesla Model 3 for those of you that don't have it yet, go to Tesla, schedule to have a rental overnight. All you need is show them DL and insurance, they won't charge you a penny!
2. Before you invest in FSD make sure the one you get has this feature, use it 50/50 while driving. The FSD is still in Beta Mode- the most thing I enjoyed about it is self-parking. But while driving It kind of freaked me out when you reach the red light and you are the one in front. The car WON'T stop! so you will be ready to stop it yourself, sure it'll switch lane's when you signal, but that is the only two things FSD does for now (self park and switch lanes when you signal-oh summon mode). For these reasons, **I don't feel like spending $6,000 for FSD** until it can recognize traffic lights and stop (completely my opinion)
3. Sound on SR+: I know a lot of audiophiles like myself are worried about the sound because of no sub- I was shocked that the audio in the SR+ is almost as good as the audio from my Porsche (the Porsche has bose sound). The SR+ sound does **NOT** suck, again for this reason, I don't think it is worth it for premium interior (10k more!), the only reason for spending that much would be for range 310 miles- however, who truly needs 300+miles /day?? sure road trips etc- but there are almost 3k supercharges in US alone, and you are supposed to take breaks when driving so that range does not bother me.
4. Interior: you can't tell the diff between SR+ or LR premium- and get the aero wheels, it improves the range!
5. the SR+ does qualify for premium rides on lfyt/uber if you want to occasionally drive- for my Porsche, I do executive airport drops, make about $300/week- wait times are bit longer but it is worth it in my opinion.

So in a nutshell, if you can afford to ditch ICE, do it for the environment, I will also be saving $12,000 on gas in 5 years of owning the model 3! ( cost me $50/month to charge- but gas I spend $250/month!)...if you want a referral code to get your free 2k supercharging free you can inbox me- have a great day everyone!",teslamotors,1569877730,Thearcngel,102,20,True,2019-09-30

242,Tesla Crashed My New P3D 1 Hour Before Delivery Today...," Today, after much fanfare and excitement, was supposed to be the day that I picked up my Tesla Model 3 AWD Dual Motor Performance Car. I had been saving up for so long to make this purchase, and I was finally able to save up enough in time to meet the deadline for the 2 years of free supercharging promotion which ends September 30th. On top of that, I was lucky enough to place a reserve on the last White P3D in stock. After placing my deposit, I eagerly awaited delivery.  


Unfortunately, today I got a call from Tesla in Fremont CA stating that they had had an incident with my vehicle, and that a collision with an object had damaged my car. I was devastated. They told me that there was nothing they could do with regards to getting me a replacement, because there is no more white in stock, but worst of all, they told me that they would not be able to honor the free 2 years of supercharger promotion, even if I waited until they found me a replacement. 

I'm hoping that there is somebody in Corporate or Executive at Tesla who can make this right. I put down my deposit, was ready with check in hand to purchase the car of my dreams, and Tesla crashed my car. I don't mind waiting a little longer now, but I would really appreciate if Tesla could at least extend the 2 years free supercharging promotion for me, or at least do something to make this right.

I had been awake since 1am that morning because our 1 year old had been quite sick, and spent about 7 hours on the road at that point. We quickly turned around to head back home, and while there was no way to make it back before he passed, I am wholly convinced that without autopilot I would not have been able to make it back. I was very tired, and it was stupid of me to drive back in my condition, wrought with grief and exhaustion, but I made it.

I rented a McLaren 720S for the weekend (I can answer questions if anyone is interested by any chance), what's amazing and shocking to me was getting back to my Model 3 afterwards it felt like a completely new car with a bunch of things I never noticed before:

1.	The seating position was amazing. It felt like driving a SUV with all the height and visibility I ever needed.

2.	For people who think the Model 3 handles sharp with a suspension that's on the firmer side, go drive a supercar like the 720S. In comparison driving my AWD Model 3 felt like...driving a pillow stuffed with cloud, in the best and worst way possible. 

3.	My Model 3's cabin insulation might as well be a Rolls Royce when compared to the 720S. It's good to be able to listen to music at less than max volume or talk to your passenger without raising your voice on the highway.

4.	The McLaren was getting something like 14 mpg on mixed highway/local driving (granted I wasn't exactly driving in an...economical manner), in contrast my Model 3 might as well be running on the anguish and tear of oil companies.

5.	The brakes in the Model 3 are much more sensitive and natural for daily driving, even discount the regen factor. The carbon ceramic brakes on the McLaren was... well let's just say stepping on the brakes does almost nothing...then...still almost nothing... and then it does **EVERYTHING**. I almost made the cars behind me rear end me a few times by stepping on the brakes too hard after getting into my Tesla.

6.	The Model 3 is *probably* faster and quicker...up to 15mph. Without launch control the 0-15mph part in the 720S feels like a Camry due to lack of rear traction and the turbo lag...then from 15-120 it feels like getting rear ended by a bullet train on AP1 (hur hur), along with all the violence, exhaust/engine noise and sound of the terrified screams of the my passenger. People laugh in my Model 3 when I floor it. They cry when I do the same in the McLaren, so not recommended as a Lyft/Uber vehicle.

7.	I think the Model 3 has more internal storage space than every single model under McLaren...combined (I'm actually dead serious on this). 

TL;DR: As an *only* car, I think the Model 3 is a slightly better choice for most people. If that's not the case for you then I envy whatever batshit insane lifestyle you have.",teslamotors,1569883429,cookingboy,0,1,True,2019-09-30

I love everything about it but I'm not crazy about the 20"" performance wheels it came with - not a big fan of their appearance (I think the stock without aero caps looks better), not a fan of the stiffer ride and not a fan of the loss in mileage (is this true or just a myth? I have a 60mi roundtrip for work and intermittent access to charging, so any gains in mileage would be welcome).

Is there anything I need to keep in mind when switching these wheels/tires out? Can I just put the stock 18"" aeros on them? (I have the upgraded brakes w/ performance package, not sure if that's an issue).

I've also heard of 19"" Tesla wheels, are these jsut larger versions of the aeros?

260,[Suggestion] Tesla's navigation should better estimate how HVAC (heat) impacts range,"It's starting to get cold again and I'm thinking about the inconveniences of cold climate driving (having initially gotten my model 3 just over a year ago). The only time I felt any range anxiety was during road trips last winter. I wish Tesla's navigation would better estimate how HVAC use impacts the range. Specifically the heat, the AC doesn't seem to hurt the range nearly as badly.

It's frustrating and stressful to be driving any reasonably long distance and have the navigation initially estimate you'll reach your destination with like 23% battery remaining and after an hour of driving it's dropped all the way to 6%. You have no idea how much further it's going to keep dropping and it can significantly change your travel plans.

Tesla must have some idea how (in)efficient the heater is. They could just calculate the effect based on the current exterior temperature and interior climate control setting. This would alleviate any range anxiety, and could allow for better planning of charging stops and range.

I know a workaround is to turn off the HVAC and turn on the seat heaters. Yeah, that sort of works for me personally, but it can still get very cold and it's hard to force upon other people. I can't imagine my buddy telling his wife and young daughter that. (Side note: Bonus points for tesla if they would update the range live between HVAC on and off so you could make a decision if it was worth it to deal with the cold, just using the seat heater.)

Anyway, thoughts?

**tl;dr:** Tesla's navigation should better estimate how HVAC impacts range using the exterior temperature and interior climate control settings. Cold climate range anxiety is real, this would significantly help alleviate it.",teslamotors,1569884852,EvanVanVan,89,135,True,2019-09-30
261,Getting back to my Model 3 after 24 hours with a McLaren 720S.,"Warning: Despite all points being factual, this post is not meant to be a serious comparison/review in any way, shape or form. But I got a small chuckle writing it.

I rented a McLaren 720S for the weekend (I can answer questions if anyone is interested by any chance), what's amazing and shocking to me was getting back to my Model 3 afterwards it felt like a completely new car with a bunch of things I never noticed before:

1.	The seating position was amazing. It felt like driving a SUV with all the height and visibility I ever needed.

2.	The *seats* were amazing. The McLaren had these P1 bucket seats that's designed for either track drivers or extremely wealthy masochists. The Mode 3's seats were wide, power adjustable, heated and sitting on it was like sitting on cotton candies. It was glorious. I'll never complain about these seats again.

3.	For people who think the Model 3 handles sharp with a suspension that's on the firmer side, go drive a supercar like the 720S. In comparison driving my AWD Model 3 felt like...driving a pillow stuffed with cloud, in the best and worst way possible. 

4.	My Model 3's cabin insulation might as well be a Rolls Royce when compared to the 720S. It's good to be able to listen to music at less than max volume or talk to your passenger without raising your voice on the highway.

5.	The McLaren was getting something like 14 mpg on mixed highway/local driving (granted I wasn't exactly driving in an...economical manner), in contrast my Model 3 might as well be running on the anguish and tear of oil companies.

6.	The brakes in the Model 3 are much more sensitive and natural for daily driving, even discount the regen factor. The CC brakes on the McLaren was... well let's just say stepping on the brakes does almost nothing...then...still almost nothing... and then it does **EVERYTHING**. I almost made the cars behind me rear end me a few times by stepping on the brakes too hard after getting into my Tesla.

7.	The Model 3 is *probably* faster and quicker...up to 15mph. Without launch control the 0-15mph part in the 720S feels like a Camry due to lack of rear traction and the turbo lag...then from 15-120 it feels like getting rear ended by a bullet train on AP1 (hur hur), along with all the violence, exhaust/engine noise and sound of the terrified screams of the my passenger. People laugh in my Model 3 when I floor it. They cry when I do the same in the McLaren, so not recommended as a Lyft/Uber vehicle.

8.	I think the Model 3 has more storage space than every single model under McLaren...combined (I'm actually dead serious on this). 

TL;DR: As an *only* car, I think the Model 3 is a slightly better choice for most people. If that's not the case for you then I envy whatever batshit insane lifestyle you have.",teslamotors,1569884913,cookingboy,157,164,True,2019-09-30

283,Serious concerns about Tesla’s smart summon,"Email I sent to Tesla:

Greetings,

I love my Tesla Model 3 and enjoy the many safety features it offers.  I enjoyed being part of the early access program testing smart summon since April.  After careful responsible use of the official public facing release over the last week, I am concerned that the future is not ready for public use. I have seen many instances when my car has done unexpected and unsafe things in a relatively calm parking lot situation. I have also seen many videos online of people using smart summon in much more risky and dangerous situations. Many videos show people smart summoning their car without it in their line of sight.

I experienced my car damaging it’s self during the beta of smart summon.  A car is a non living thing.  A person being hit or a car with people in it being hit would be a different story.

I want Tesla to be successful. I am afraid that this feature is going to create serious problems for the company and for the safety of the public.

&gt;One of our designs has a peak power density of around 15 kilowatts per kilogram. Compare that with today’s motors, such as the one in the all-electric BMW i3, which delivers a peak power density of 3 kW/kg—or just one-fifth as much. And the Magnax machine is also more efficient.

Obviously a lot of weight comes from the batteries, and that technology is also improving. But there is still a significant weight in the motors, and this technology promises a way to cut that down as well. It is great to see other players in the market also pushing the efficiency boundary!

353,Could a Model 3 fly (I can't post a question mark in a title because it will get deleted),"No, seriously.  A Cessna Skylane is a very, very popular aircraft which has been produced since the 1950s.  It's powered by a 540 cubic inch engine rated at ~300hp at sea level.  Cruise at 75% power yields 225hp.   It weighs in at a whopping 440lbs


The model 3 rear motor easily matches these specifications and apparently has some very good cooling design which would likely be able to tolerate 75% power for a long duration.  


Apart from the obvious weight of the batteries, could it fly?

RPMs in an aircraft are generally around 2500 and cooling is a lot easier at 150mph.  What would the failure modes be?   Automotive conversions have typically suffered from bearing issues and inability to tolerate high power conditions for sustained periods (car engines aren't made to run continuously at 75% but rather 15 or 20% on the highway).",teslamotors,1569942858,YukonBurger,0,1,True,2019-10-01

376,Tesla not honoring deal,"TL:DR- purchased a Tesla model 3 with 2 years free supercharging and 2 free deviations. Now they will not give me the 2 years free charging. 

I purchased a model 3 a few weeks ago, while the promotion was 2 free deviations &amp; 2 years  of free supercharging. This was told to me verbally by two different sales representatives (I know, should have been in writing.) So I purchased the vehicle on those terms. Upon delivery, the 2 free deviations were honored (paint &amp; rim upgrade). I went to a supercharger and it charged me $7. I called the sales representative and asked what is going on. They informed me that the promotion changed before I took delivery, but after I put the deposit on the vehicle.

377,How does everyone feel about V10 autopilot lane centering changes?,"Just did a 50 mile trip and here are my observations: 
1. Autopilot definitely will bias away from large trucks and buses. I think this is being done visually rather than with radar because the car starts shifting over before it gets into radar range. 

2. Autopilot will do this even if there is a car on the other side. Ie, I’m in the middle lane and there’s a truck coming up on the right and there a car on the left. It actually made me a little uncomfortable with how close I got to the car on the left, but maybe it’s just because it’s new behavior. 

3. Ramps - this may just be placebo and I only got to do two of them but I feel like the car hugs in the inside line a little more than before. Does seem more natural.",teslamotors,1569951621,dreamincolor,0,1,True,2019-10-01

I am not sure when this started happening, my car won't connect to wifi at home anymore.

I have used DHCP to assign a static IP to the car's MAC address.

I removed the static IP setting and still same issue.

I have Asus rt-AC3100 router with AI mesh to a AC-68U node.

Attached two pictures to show the issue.

Router would show car connect with wifi, but a few seconds later wifi connection drops and router thinks car connected with ethernet. It just goes back and forth like this.

So passengers can put on Netflix from the main screen for rear passengers to watch while driving, or play Tesla Arcade, draw etc. This can be done on the back of the driver and passenger seats. Screens should also have an HDMI port to attach either a gaming system or media player. 

\-Cup holders for captains chairs, and wireless phone charging for front passengers

\-Better Range, I feel like 600km is the sweet spot.

That's it. If the Model X had those 3 features, it would make it much more attractive to choose it over the Model Y.

Leading up to the collision, his foot was off the accelerator, and the car tried to slow down (not quick enough).

Post collision - airbags were deployed, hazards came on, but the car started to reverse itself quite quickly - looking at the dashcam vendor of the car behind my friends. It reversed in a diagonal alignment, not maintain the lane markings ultimately colliding with the dashcam vehicle. 

Smoke was coming out of the car and my friend was trying to get out of the car.

I reached out to the message board on our community website and Ted responded kindly and offered for me to check out his ride. His is not a performance model, but the acceleration is absolutely intoxicating. 

We took a drive so he could show me some quirks and things about the car, then he also kindly offered for me to drive it. Obviously I couldn't pass that up. First impressions sitting in the car.

1. The interior is incredibly nice. Even though it's for the minimalist, it feels very premium.

2. The acceleration is absolutely astonishing. That's really the only words I can come up with. When I was riding in the passenger seat, I could feel it in my gut how fast it was. Almost even got a little light headed cause I wasn't expecting it. 

3. The autopilot was surreal. I have a pilot background and i understand how it works, but you truly can't comprehend how it works so well in this car. Yeah it's not perfect and there are some weird things about it.  I was watching the radar of the cars going by and as well as the lines on the road, it does a very good job of keeping track, and it can only get better.

4. Passing other cars is an absolute breeze. Pulled up to a red light, mashed the gas, another driver pulled out two lanes just to get in front of me. I slowed down and observed where he was going, then went past him with ease. It's always nice when a car can give you that chuckling feeling.

Overall it seems like a fantastic car. I don't have a very long commute but anything to make it easier is a big deal. And being able to completely remove your hands from the wheel and pedals is a wild feeling.

If a previous owner has used super chargers too often; has over charged the batter packs consistently or allowed the battery packs to fully discharge, it would have degraded the capacity and the life of the battery packs especially if done a lot (along with other poor battery hygiene).

My question is, how can I determine if the batter packs of a second hand Tesla (in particular the Model 3) are in good condition and have been looked after well?

53,Sentry mode convenience,"*I originally wrote this as a reply to a comment in that disturbing video post with the armed thief caught by sentry mode, but decided to make this a separate post. I hope this doesn't violate the rules :/*

I've been thinking about sentry mode for a while now; I just got a model 3 about a week ago, and I'm extremely pleased. However, one of the few things I find annoying is the amount of effort it takes to review the footage.

I'm would like to design an embedded USB device to help with some of the shortcomings of having to work with with a flash drive manually all the time. For starters, I want a device that presents itself to the Tesla as an ordinary flash drive, but actually will offload recorded footage when you park your car at home overnight, or while at work. The footage can be moved automatically to a network storage device, and/or cloud storage.

An upgraded version could have a cellular modem for backup to the cloud in situations where footage has to be saved in an emergency, e.g. accelerometer detects impact, thermistor detects excessive heat, microphone detects break-in or car alarm going off, etc. That would at least solve the problem of ever having to touch the flash drive again.

**As Tesla owners, do you think this product would be useful?** And what features would you like it to have that would add to the value, for you? Unless there are other suggestions, my next step would be auto filtering the footage with a motion detector and/or image classification neural net. It could email or text message you with notable stills and timestamps from the video, e.g. the neural network classified a firearm, or a human wearing a hoodie, or balaclava, or other suspicious thing.

Ideally, I would like my vehicle to compliment my existing surveillance system. I live in a very bad area of my city, and I'm probably going to finally move away just because I purchased a vehicle that might make me a target. So, sentry mode is really important to me, too.

1. *Tesla may come out with built-in similar features, eventually*

Okay. Not much I can do about this, but I'd rather not wait.

2. *There are guides on how to setup xyz device to something similar*

Guides are not feasible or practical for 95%+ percent of people. I want a standalone embedded product that does just this.

3. *This product already exists.*

Currently, all salary sacrifice company car drivers in the UK pay a minimum of 16% of the car's value as a tax called Benefit In Kind.
[In April 2020, the BIK rate for EVs is reducing to 0%](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/taxable-benefits-in-kind-and-expenses-payments-company-car-tax-rules-2005-to-2016). From 2021 it will be 1% and April 2022 it will be 2%.

I work for NHS, and I discovered that all public sectors are affiliated with a company called Fleet Solutions, which offer salary sacrifice schemes to lease brand new cars. There might be more companies like this, but my only experience is with this one.

I submitted a request on the Tesla website to ask about inventory. The sales person took almost an hour to respond and they were incredibly helpful. A inventory 3 was located with my exact specs. After a few days of paying, it was sent to my house. There are no Tesla dealerships in my state, so I had to meet the delivery driver at the local Walmart to get the EV. The Walmart is about a half a mile from my house, such an inconvenience. Get this, when the 3 arrived and I inspected it. I found that the mileage was incorrect. The web site said the vehicle had 50 miles and it arrived with 2. I was expecting panel gaps, and I found none.  The store left me a present in the console thanking me for my 4th Tesla purchase. No manufacturing defects. It has been a couple of weeks and there have been no problems. Best vehicle experience of my life. I did not have to sit in a chair while the sales person consulted a manager or pick from what was on the lot. Great work Tesla!

I heard about one foot driving/regenerative braking or whatever it’s called and I want to know what this is.

126,Tesla Body Shop in Santa Clara - 2 experiences,"Unfortunately my vehicle has been to the body shop twice. I thought I'd write a review of this shop for those in the Bay Area that are looking at places to get their car repaired.

Right off the bat, let me say that communication with the body shop is miserable. It's rare for them to answer their phone and e-mails can go days without response. The front desk people there are very nice and very helpful when you're in the shop, but it can be a black hole otherwise. My most recent repair, I actually had to walk in there to see what was going on with my car because calling/emailing was getting me nothing. Once the car is assessed, you get an estimator to communicate with and that tends to be 24 hours or less response time.
  
1st visit was April of 2019. Front end fender bender caused the vehicle to be in their shop for more than a month. The parts order process for them seems very lax. They weren't sure when they'd arrive from Tesla and would just check the weekly deliveries to see if my parts were on the truck. Once the parts arrived, the car went from disassembly, repair, reassembly, paint and QA rather quickly. Once I received the car, I had a green notice on the screen letting me know autopilot features were currently unavailable and may be available next time I start the car.  I had had the front rebuilt basically as well as windshield replaced so I figured it was re-calibrating and would fix itself. Then I noticed the thermostat wasn't working either. A few days later I took it to the Tesla Service Center in Sunnyvale where they discovered several cables not attached or loosely attached. This should've been caught at the QA area. A week or so later I also realized that the frunk hood was rubbing against the front of the car as the weather warmed up. More on that  in the next visit.
  
My 2nd visit was in August of 2019 and was more of a cosmetic repair caused by a hit and run. This time the car was in the shop 8 days before they were able to assess the damage and another 8 days to repair the damage. The rear bumper cover was replaced and side panels repaired / repainted. I mentioned the frunk rubbing and after some back and forth, agreed to adjust the frunk to stop the rubbing. 8 days later, the car was ready to come home. This time everything was in perfect working order and I'm 100% satisfied with the service.
  
As a bonus, they discovered some scratches on the front right side of my bumper (some floor tiles had fallen on it and scratched it up very badly). Those scratches are completely gone. They definitely went above and beyond there. 

So all in all, I'd definitely continue using them with the understanding of what to expect. Hopefully I'll never be back there again. People need to stay the heck away from my car....",teslamotors,1567289467,Wavern,7,16,True,2019-08-31
130,Supercharger - etiquette and thoughts for the Tesla app (broadcasting car names and allowing chats between owners),"Did my first road trip in my AWD P3D- today and ended it at a Supercharger. All went well except for a bit of range anxiety as the car predicted I would finish with 15 miles to spare.

Along the way, my wife and I were talking about Supercharger etiquette/scenarios such as ""What happens if someone just leaves their car at a slot overnight (ie ones near hotels)""

That got me thinking, wouldn't it be nice if the Tesla app showed car names at the Supercharger station and allowed you to message other Tesla owners if the station was full or you wondered if anyone was nearly finished? 

This could be an opt-in system and use the car name rather than the owner's real name.

According to the track, 220 racers showed up making it an all-time record for this particular event. Of the 220 participants, 7 of them were Teslas from the local MN Tesla owners group. Even with the large crowds and long turn around times between runs many of us still managed to sneak in 4-5 runs. As with the last Wednesday Night Street Drags event, I was able to capture both the data and footage from each pass which can be viewed here 1) Video (time slips included) -&gt; [https://bit.ly/2PAd1Ub](https://t.co/hTcnrPpBiG?amp=1) 2) Individual Pass Data -&gt; [https://bit.ly/2MOOXuh](https://t.co/tqzMe0O1tm?amp=1) In my first race I lined up against another M3P piloted by /u/geekandi. As with our previous races it was neck &amp; neck and basically came down to the reaction time. In the 3rd race I lined up against a fellow MN Tesla club member who was racing his 2018 Model S P100D.  It was truly impressive to see the Model S run me down like I was standing still around the 1000ft mark. Finally, the last race was very special to me as it was against my father in his 610HP 1967 Chevy C10 pickup. We have been talking smack for almost a year about who would win so it was good to finally answer that question. He had an awesome RT of 0.043 not to mention a speedy 1.773 60ft time however I was able to reel him in around half track. He has requested a rematch next year as he said he wants to add more HP over the winter :). All in all it was a blast and I'll definitely be doing more of these events next year.

257,Transit Time,"
So, let me preface this by giving you some back story. I ordered a Model 3 back in early August, VIN assignment was taking forever, so I was actively looking at inventory cars (ordered a pearl white LR AWD) and found one that said it was at the Fremont Delivery Hub, so I’d be able to avoid transport fees. So placed a new order on that VIN, had my other order cancelled. Once I got my paperwork, my advisor and I soon found out that car was already in transit to Chicago. I live in DFW. After a few days of Tesla trying to redirect, they finally got the car on a truck, however, it hasn’t moved according to them. They looked up the load, and it was the only car on the load. So apparently, my car is sitting on the back of a truck, somewhere in the Chicago area. It was originally given an ETA of 9/3.... but now it just says unknown lol.

They are confident it will arrive DFW this week, technically speaking its only about 15-ish hours away driving, so a two-work-day drive, right? Wondering what other’s people’s feedback is on it.

While saving confusion on the customers part in terms of what model to buy when new, the changes/improvements between say a 2017 and 2019 might not be as apparent. Which when buying second hand would be very valuable information.

Does a list with the changes made over time already exist? If not, I’d be interested in compiling one, a timeline showcasing the improvements/changes made to the Model 3 physically and software wise as a guide for people to use when picking a specific model to buy. Model 3 specifically because it’s the mass market Tesla. Global VIN numbers and production times would be most useful for gauging when the specific Model 3 you’re looking at etc.",teslamotors,1567383170,ArkDenum,13,13,True,2019-09-01

270,One year of owning a Model 3,"It was on this day last year that I took delivery of my pearl white, LR RW Tesla Model 3. 

I had stood in line two years previous to reserve the car, and was open to order it sometime around April of 2018. However, my wife and I hemmed and hawed over making the purchase, as we'd hoped to be able to pick up a more affordable version. We live in Ontario, and felt we could only truly afford even a shorter range version because of a provincial rebate for $14,000. 

By the time April of last year rolled around, it seemed clear that the rebate was going to go away, because of a provincial election, in which the conservative party - who'd promised to eliminate the rebate - was likely to win.

We decided to go ahead with our purchase in June, completing our order, but only after the incoming government promised to honour the rebate to people who ordered the car before they took power. Then, about two weeks after we ordered it, the government cancelled the rebate without warning, leaving us in limbo as we *definitely* didn't feel that we could afford the car without the rebate (it had a base price of $65,000 and came to $74,000 Canadian with tax). 

While they cancelled the rebate, they allowed *all* EVs ordered by companies with dealerships in Ontario a grace period that extended to September 14th. For any EV manufactured by Chevy, Nissan, and all the others, owners with cars delivered by the 14th of September would be eligible to receive the rebate. Because Tesla didn't have a dealership model, they were excluded. However, in Ontario their stores *were* registered as dealerships, which put the PC Party's argument on very shaky ground.

I then spent a huge chunk of the summer trying to contact the government, reaching out to my own local representative, getting in touch with the provincial Ombudsman, talking to the media here in Toronto about it, and debating on Twitter literally anyone and everyone who supported the revocation of the rebate without the Conservatives honouring their pledge to allow all previous orders to receive the promised $14,000. 

I eventually caught the notice of Dan Kim, who was then a Tesla exec. He put me in touch with a lawyer at Tesla, who I then aided in gathering contacts and information as Tesla decided to move forward and sue the government.

There was a lot of which to be afraid. While the rebate was in limbo, my wife and I had to decide if we needed to cancel our order. Tesla was gracious enough to offer a full refund of all deposits, but I believed we might be able to get the government to reverse course. However, if the car was built and delivered before they changed their mind, then we ran the risk of potentially having to buy the car for a full price we couldn't afford. And if the car was built and delivered after September 14th (the aforementioned final day of rebate eligibility), then we would no longer be eligible, even if the government changed its mind, or was forced to comply.

It was announced on August 27th that Tesla won the lawsuit, which was delivered in a scathing summary written by the presiding justice. That meant they only had two weeks to build and deliver our order before we'd still end up missing the window. 

As soon as the verdict was made, I emailed Dan Kim asking if our car was being built. Later that day, I was given a call and informed that our car was on a train for Toronto. Only five days later, it arrived.

(An interesting side note - the PC government later lost a separate suit, and in that instance, the Premier chose to use a provincial privilege of rejecting the judge's verdict, temporarily for a total of five years, at which point the verdict would go into effect. Doug Ford could have used it in the case of the Tesla suit as well. I wonder if he considered it at the time?)

Anyway - I was going to actually write a review of my experience of actually owning the car, but it turned into this instead. If there's interest, maybe in the comments below I will actually share my experiences.

272,My Model 3 REALLY impressed me tonight,"I was driving home after shopping this evening with my fiance. It's dark out and raining, so visibility is pretty poor. The cool rain was falling on to hot asphalt so there was some steam coming up from the roadways as well to make things all the better.

We were driving down a country road going about 45 MPH with TACC enabled but not AutoSteer. Out of nowhere, my Model 3 starts to brake pretty hard and I'm thinking oh, how nice, another instance of phantom braking. Normally I step on the gas during these events to get my car back up to speed but I didn't this time and I'm glad I didn't. 

It turns out a person in dark clothing on a bicycle with no lights on was traveling in the same direction as we were on the right-hand side of the road. I couldn't see him until I was right up on him.

My Model 3 saw him well enough in advance to start braking so I could safely pass him at a reasonable speed. I was SHOCKED the car even spotted him. It was dark, moderately raining, foggy from the roadways, and he was off to the side of the road, and through it all, it saw him and started braking. 

The vision system may not be perfect yet, but tonight I'm more thrilled with my car than usual. Just thought I would share.",teslamotors,1567385391,idealdreams,61,396,True,2019-09-01

My wall charger has already arrived and the electrician is already working on getting parts to get enough power in the garage for it!

However, I keep seeing on the forums about unbundling the Performance Upgrade Package with the Performance model. So it sounds like I would be able to get the Performance model with the 18 inch wheels, non performance brakes, no spoiler, etc. This seems to cause the car to be about 10% more efficient because of the 18 inch vs 20 inch wheels. I have a few questions about this:

1. Is this configuration still available if you go through someone in Tesla Sales? It sounds like this was the ""Stealth"" package which isn't available anymore.
2. How much does doing this actually save in price of the car (assuming it is still available)?
3. Does this cause the 0-60 time to be the same, or do I lose a few tenth's of a second because of the smaller wheels?

I've always wanted to try it, and I saw the auto park button for the first time.  Well, I clicked it. It backed up without a sharp enough turn and was crooked from the start.

I wasn't very disappointed now, I didn't care that it was taking time, as long as it parked correctly. But then it started backing up, and as it got to the back, the car stopped. It was crooked. So much that the front of the car was slightly over the right line, and the back touching the left line. 

I rate that 2 out of 5 stars. But then the parking spot on the screen flipped sideways, and then my car out of nowhere moved backwards and the back wheel hit the curb and I hit the brakes and it said auto park aborted. 

0/5 stars. A short time after this I hit the dashcam button. I'm still learning how to use these features, as I've only had FSD for a couple weeks and the car for around a month, so I'll see if it caught the video when I check the flash drive.",teslamotors,1567480531,fflip8,35,11,True,2019-09-02

I have a problem, and I hope someone here can help me with my issue.

I would like to take a test drive with a Model 3, so I went to their website and filled the form. The answer was ""You will be notified when there is a slot free for a test ride in your region"". The problem is that I live in Dresden, Germany. And there is no Tesla store anyway close by. I would have to go all the way to Berlin to do this, which is something that I am ok with, but I am quite sure the system will not tell me when there is a slot in Berlin, if he knows I live in Dresden.

I tried calling the stores in Berlin but, to my surprise, all I get is a machine message walking me through the different sections of the website! No chance to talk to any human being at all. Once the message is over, it hangs on me.

How could I solve my issue? How could I make it known to Tesla that I would like to get a test ride IN BERLIN, even though I do not live close by?

It's my understanding that the battery pack is in the cab portion of the vehicle and that the range is 500-600 miles. That's great for short hops, but not sustainable for long-haul drivers. 

My idea, why don't they build the trailer portion also? Instead of building a traditional trailer, make the floor or a sub-floor all battery. Granted batteries of that size would take a while to charge up, but that should be fine. Charge the trailers while they are sitting in the loading bays of warehouses and they should be good to go for their next trip.

Current trailers could be retrofitted with batteries or they could be left for the daily, short-haul trip. 

Obviously the cab would still have it's own battery pack, but hooking up the trailer could give the whole setup an additional immense range for long-haul.",teslamotors,1567534393,smartass505,12,0,True,2019-09-03

477,Tesla should offer a 'gas guzzler' credit ... a spin off on the 'gas guzzler' tax.,"First, this isn't meant to come off as some 'Tesla sales are plateauing' post. It's just a general/fun idea.

The concept is pretty simple - Offer a small, but meaningful, credit for those who trade in a car, truck or SUV of 'X' age which falls below 'Y' fuel economy. Sort of, in a sense, a spin on paying a gas guzzler tax. Like a gas guzzler tax reimbursement. 

Outside of wanting to reduce your footprint, or wanting a Tesla in general, there is no real incentive/urgency to purchase one while gas prices remain so low. It's a big part of the reason why high horsepower sedans, big SUV's, and trucks are so heavily desired right now here in the US. It's also why people who drive older, but not paid off, gas sucking vehicles who no longer need them, hold off on moving into something new... The ""I don't need this big SUV, but it's nice to have the space and the cost to fill it isn't killing me"".

I think this idea would be an interesting one to test out. I'm not talking some $10k+ trade incentive, but even something small but somewhat meaningful. 

Yes, it would cut into the bottom line slightly, but it would also only help to sell more cars while driving home the mission statement.",teslamotors,1567544804,TheTimeIsChow,6,0,True,2019-09-03

I finally intervene and start braking, which felt funny too when I engaged it.  Never experienced this before.  Footage doesn’t appear that drastic, but it was…

2) NOA on interstate, no video save, tried to take the exit long before the exit even started.   Nooo, that will put me into the barrier, intervened and went 1/4mi further where the exit lane actually started.  I had taken the exit before with no problems.  Could be the software ver 19.32  has a map update in it which is incorrect for that exit.

Rest of trip was uneventful, except the very twisty mountains where it had a couple problems with tight curves, speed was the issue, it nailed 98% of them.  Pretty cool on most it slowed down from posted speed going into them or shortly after entering them.   The ones it got into trouble on it didn’t automatically slow down and went in hot and couldn’t hold the turn. It may have corrected itself, but I really wasn’t that interested in finding out with a huge dropoff into the forest.    

Surprisingly when I was driving through those twisties I was touching that yellow line more than when autopilot was engaged.  It is tedious staying between the lines with constant unending twisties up and down the mountains unless you’re on a motorcycle that is where the fun begins….",teslamotors,1567553425,GoTesla,5,29,True,2019-09-03
495,For those who's cars still don't connect in the app.,"Go into the gear icon and sign out, and then log back in. Your car should come up. My car has been disconnected from the app since the outage, but I figured trying that was worth a shot, and it worked! Hope this helped someone.",teslamotors,1567554892,BigJSteal,0,1,True,2019-09-03
