I've been a Tesla owner for a couple years now and there's a few stops that I've been to that have been ruined by people post ads on the superchargers. 

Not only does this look visually horrendous, but I also don't appreciate being advertised to like this. 

Furthermore, when somebody (like me) inevitably comes along and removes your intrusive and unwanted sticker from a supercharger stall, it leaves behind a residue.

Lastly, Tesla is all about sustainability, and you putting your foam ad boards in the ground and stickers everywhere does not help further the cause.

33,Rant about Tesla’s infotainment &amp; software priorities,"This is not about AP or FSD.

For reference, I drive a 2020 3LRD, but I’m sure this is relevant to S &amp; X as well.

Some of the things I mention here are nit-picky, but some are legitimate “I paid enough for this car that this should be sorted” issues.

Start rant;

Does anyone else not give a hoot about having video games in their car? I’ve literally played 
backgammon twice, and haven’t even opened any of the other games. And why add all these video 
streaming services when they haven’t even gotten the music streaming services right yet?

My frustration is that Tesla are putting too much emphasis on party-trick functions that I can't use while driving (even if FSD one day works, it’s at least a few years before we’ll be able to watch TV or game while driving), instead of fixing/improving real features that I CAN use while driving. I have no problem with the party-tricks, but fix the real functions first. Owners are reporting all sorts of issues/complaints that seem to be getting ignored. A few examples off the top of my head;

- Spotify badly needs updating; sorting, 320kbps (for Spotify premium subscribers), podcasts, 
gapless playback / caching. Why pay for Tesla premium + Spotify premium only to lose 
features and quality? I can stream 4K YouTube, but not 320kbps music? WTF!? (in before 
you say to use Bluetooth from my phone. I am, but I shouldn’t have to)

- Auto-Wipers need a sensitivity setting NOT a neural net. Honestly, they work, but the
problem is that they’re currently not “one-size fits all”. People have different preferences on 
how they want their wipers to work, and a neural net won’t change that. For me, I find the 
auto-wipers far too aggressive. They go full speed when I only want intermittent. Just give us a user adjustable sensitivity setting. The solution is so simple!

- Auto-dimming mirrors; Again, we need a sensitivity setting or a manual control.

- Climate control; I’ve given up on auto-climate. It’s ok in mild weather, but doesn’t cope with 
the random weather where I live. It never cools my feet on a really hot day, and blows hot 
air in my face when it’s cold. Swap the F/R demisters and seat heaters off of the main screen and put the climate controls there instead. Or at the very least put manual fan speed on the 
main screen!

- Better yet, make the quick access bar at the bottom of the screen customizable. I’m not the 
first to suggest this. This will keep everyone happy.

- Even on manual mode the A/C temperature fluctuates. In this mode the temperature setting 
should control the vent temperature, but it seems to be going off the overall cabin temperature. So if the cabin temp is 23C and you set the A/C to 21C, it makes the air colder 
than 21C.

- Auto-high beams are an absolute joke. I can’t even.

I know there are lots of other features/fixes that people want too, but I can’t cover everything here. It sucks that only requests from famous tweeters get any traction, and I’m sure most of the things I've mentioned are relatively easy to change.

I just want Tesla to prioritise the useful stuff.

65,Software liscensed to a single owner is the future of vehicle manufacturers and Tesla opened the door.,"Even if Tesla reversed the decision and gave the software access back to the owner it would not make a difference. This has just opened the eyes of every vehicle manufacturer across the globe. The profit potential here is absurd. It could eventually lead to having to pay the manufacturer for the ability to purchase a used car because it will not run with all the software deactivated.

Cars built before the ability to remotely disable software will go up in value while newer used vehicles will drop significantly in value. With Tesla's pricing on the two features removed, $8,000, is just a fraction of the total value of the software. I see this leading down a very dark and dirty path where a 5 year old used vehicle cost 10-15k just to liscense the software for your use. 

At the very least this should be implemented as a software lease with low payments or maybe just as a monthly subscription for software updates. No one knows how long a vehicle will last them and after paying a huge cash sum for the software just to have the vehicle totalled a year later would be very infuriating.

71,Tesla offering absolutely no loaner or reasonable accommodation whatsoever.,"The BMS fuse blew at 15k miles. Service and tow (maintenance center is 70 miles away) are covered under warranty, which cost THOUSANDS of dollars, but they gave us $700 in Uber credit and refuse to give us a loaner for the time being, and have given us zero ETA on how long it'll be in the shop??? When we called the service center and asked the person's name on the phone, they HUNGGGG UP and didn't give it to us. Thanks, Tyson's Corner!

ANY loaner, be it a Tesla or literally anything else, they've refused. They offered $50/day for a loaner, but found out my boyfriend's age and then said we get nothing. They told my boyfriend to Uber 60 miles each way to work, and said ""someone will eventually pick you up, otherwise you'll have to rely on family and friends."" It costs $70+ to get to his job ONE WAY. That $700 will not even last a week, not to mention you're only allowed to use $100/day of the credit, so he can only get one way. Tipping the driver comes from your card, they don't cover that.

This is not luxury customer service. This is not $45k car customer service.

When our Hyundai had an engine malfunction, the $2k warranty covered an ENTIRE engine and trans swap, as well as a brand new 2019 loaner for a WHOLE month that we ran up 7,000 miles in the time we had it. They charged NOTHING for that. THAT is customer service.

We've done nothing but hype this car up since we got it, because sure it's cool and cheap to drive, but at only 15k miles, at no fault of our own, we're already being treated like shit by the company. What's to come for the other 400k+ miles it'll run? If by Monday we are not treated with the decency we deserve, we're selling it.

I love the S, it's gorgeous. Got in tinkered a bit, hit my head on the A pillar getting out and I are a short person. 

Got in a 3. Much more comfy to me and I'm only 5'7. Asked if I could test drive. They gave me a 3 that said dual motor on the back. 

Then left me alone. I drove around the parking lot for like 20 minutes just trying to figure out how to do X, Y Z because this is definitely NOT like the average car. Even having driven a Prius the regenerative breaking was really hard to get used to- the car doesnt coast at all..... weird (I get it, its just feels strange since I've never had a car do that before)

Had a chance to get on the highway but chose not too because until an hour ago I didnt know where the Tesla store was, so finding it again might be hard. Really just took an extended stroll around the block getting up to speed in some suburban traffic.

Quick bit of googlefu I realize now that the one I drove wasnt the base 3, but since I never really punched the throttle I likely didnt get to use any of the performance upgrades. 

I've been dreaming about an S for years (Way way way out of my price range). Also need to probably buy a house since apartment life makes charging super hard and I cant charge at work. So it might be a while but damn. I definitely want a 3 or maybe a Y (Will check them out once theyre available. But the 3 was super nice.)

105,Things I want in the Model S," Hey all, I am a Tesla fan from Serbia, and I absolutely love their cars, especially the Model S. Currently, I am looking into buying one for myself, but have ran into some issues. My current car is a Mazda 6, and I was blown away by its features compared to my previous BMW. I've looked into Tesla and it seems to be missing lots of features that my Mazda has. For example, they don't offer perforated cooled seats and no 360 camera. My biggest gripe are the cooled seats though, because driving a car without them on my 9 hour 1000km road trip in the middle of summer is hell. And thus, I would really like to see them added. Another thing I dislike about the current gen Model S and X is the lack of alcantara on the dashboard. It used to make the interiors look unique, but now they look very dull. Also, I noticed that the 1500 optional ultrawhite interior on the Model S has a black lower dash area, why? It triggers my OCD so bad! So, I would love for that to be re-added.

129,Next Tesla Model,"From what I know Tesla and maybe even Elon have said that Cybertruck will be the last “new” model from Tesla for a while.

I can’t remember the original transaction but I think Elon had mentioned eventually producing a more affordable model (sub 30k). After seeing those concept images from China (which really doesn’t confirm anything), as well as seeing renders from enthusiasts it got me wondering will this more affordable model be the next released? And if so in what shape and form could it take? And what would it take from Tesla’s standpoint to produce and make money off of its sale?

I’m not an engineer by an means but, I think an interesting idea would be a Model 3 coupe. A 2-door model 3 that still has seats in the back like the new roadster if needed but overall a shorter car. Depending on what they could put on it I think a 54-62kWh battery would be great for something that size and would albeit crush most of the competition at this car’s size. I think something like the China concept is great for buyers over there and Europe which could lead to awesome sales but something that small and compact might not sell too well in the States.

On Tesla’s end what is stopping them from making this more affordable model? I think a number of reasons come to mind. First and foremost, profit. I think Tesla being sold as a luxury brand benefits them right now while EVs are still growing in popularity (along with high price points) and they probably make more money with their higher end models and prices. Secondly production capacity, if I recall correctly Tesla has specialized plants and assembly lines for each model (like most car manufacturers), and the cost and logistics of bringing a new one on line in addition to all of their other projects isn’t feasible right now. (Though in my Model 3 coupe example, I would hope they could use most of the Model 3 parts and thus the same plants, to circumvent this issue). And lastly maybe they are waiting for better battery tech or at least better battery sourcing and production to help them cut costs in that area.

If you read all of this thanks! It’s something I’ve thought about a lot because there are still a lot of people who can’t afford a $35k+ (cheapest) car. A lot of more affordable EVs like the E-golf for example don’t have competitive range unless you live in the city you work and never really want to leave. Tesla is obviously poised on so many different fronts to take this on, but in what shape and form and what does the timeline look like? Even if they cut some of the more “luxury” features out of their affordable model, I’m sure people would still love it.

TLDR: Tesla has said there will be no new models for a while. What will the next one be? The affordable model? What form could this take, and why hasn’t Tesla made it yet?",teslamotors,1581270965,Ionicxplorer,89,1,True,2020-02-09

I'll be visiting with Vocational Services to figure out driving aids that might work, but the ones they mentioned at the prelim visit didn't strike me as helpful (steering knob).  They mentioned audio driving but I don't think they meant actual driving I think they meant controls other than driving.

139,Autopilot rewrite with 3d labeling is only starting to use FSD computer’s potential,"Elon Musk revealed a [foundational Autopilot rewrite](https://youtu.be/_a6lF2Ss3G4?t=81) to combine planning, perception and image recognition trained on 3d-labeled data, and this departs from primarily focusing on individually-labeled main camera frames that has worked great for highway Autopilot optimized for HW2. This is likely to address the remaining concerns back in October from [2019 Q3 earning call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/24/tesla-inc-tsla-q3-2019-earnings-call-transcript.aspx): “Now we need to work on solving the intermediate portion which is traffic lights and stop signs, and navigating through … windy narrow roads in suburban neighborhoods.”

Notably windy roads are difficult because the lane edges can leave the view of the main camera, and similarly traffic lights and stop signs can be hard to see from the stop line when using only the main camera. Here’s a screenshot from a [greentheonly video](https://youtu.be/OdKA5Y7nXMY?t=25) where the fisheye camera has enough vision to predict the yellow lines while the main camera barely sees the right edge of the destination lane and fails to make a lane prediction.

[View greentheonly city neural network output screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/z03juk7l3yf41.jpg?width=2240&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2983ccfd493730bc4c20e384c7f486c7f8c59603)

Also from greentheonly videos, you can count the frames between neural network updates where the main camera updates every frame while all other cameras update every 4th frame. This sampling is likely limited by Autopilot optimized for HW2 to handle 99 total frames per second using up \~90% of the compute budget. But with FSD computer having 21 times the capacity, this sampled frame rate is only \~5% of the budget, and going to full 36 frame per second from 8 cameras would increase to \~14% of compute.

One main benefit of FSD computer treating all cameras equally means the neural network can make a unified prediction based on the combined vision instead of having the neural network make individual predictions for some frames then post-process stitching together that information. Again referring to the greentheonly screenshot, notice how Left Pillar labels Bus ID 29 but misses it in Fisheye while L. Truck is ID 2 in Imm-Left Lane from Left Pillar conflicts with ID 21 in My Lane from Fisheye. These conflicting neural network outputs makes it undesirable to write code to decide which outputs to trust vs discard, so that’s why current Autopilot just simply favors information from the main camera, e.g., predicted path, traffic light color visualizations.

&amp;#x200B;

Last June at [International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)](https://slideslive.com/38917690/multitask-learning-in-the-wilderness), Andrej Karpathy mentioned compute budget constraints on the design of the neural network architecture leading to the multi-task structure needing separate outputs stitched together. Below is his slide showing path prediction using two heads (unlabeled shaded rectangles at the top) that pull data from different sets of cameras, and potentially the architecture with the rewrite is to have a single path prediction head based on all cameras, and likely many other aspects of the architecture have been combined and simplified with the rewrite.

[View Karpathy path prediction architecture](https://preview.redd.it/85sezo6p3yf41.png?width=1662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c649cfd07ff52ce8e6da433e9b7f74575261ac4)

Karpathy also showed at [PyTorch DevCon](https://youtu.be/oBklltKXtDE?t=279) late last year a top-down road layout prediction directly from a recurrent neural network instead of needing traditional C++ code to stitch up multiple image-space predictions. So the rewrite seems to be reassessing previous constraints and moving to the next level of taking advantage of FSD computer’s additional compute budget to use all cameras to make 3d-labeled predictions that also leverages Tesla’s ability to gather a lot of training data at 288 frames per second.

&amp;#x200B;

Even when improving existing predictions by using all cameras at full frame rate, FSD computer still has a lot more capacity for more outputs. If one considers ""Autopilot optimized for HW2"" as using 5% of FSD computer capability providing quite amazing highway driving feature today, and the ""all camera Autopilot"" using 15%, it's exciting to think of what Tesla + FSD computer can do with the remaining compute for ""5 additional"" features that match the complexity the ""all camera Autopilot.""",teslamotors,1581276451,harikaried,223,1,True,2020-02-09

159,Some confusion about diagnosis,"So back in September I purchased a brand new Model 3 LR AWD. Recently after about 6k miles, the car developed two distinct “noises”. One from the front suspension where if you go on a ramp or something with a height difference, the car makes a loud “creaking” sound like an old rocking chair. And a second one which sounds like a brake squeak but appears whenever you put the car into drive, regardless of whether you’re pushing on the brakes or if the car is even moving or not. I’m worried about the first sound in particular because that could very well be the control arms or bushings. 

Now I know the logical answer is: “just take it in for service!” But last time I went to service for a cabin rattle, Tesla was ready to charge me for a diagnosis fee for the ride along and finding the rattle but they finally stepped back from it after I told them how ridiculous it was for a car with less than a 1000 miles to even have a rattle to begin with. 

Do you guys think Im gonna end up having to pay a diagnostic fee for these two problems if I take it in for service??

192,We want REALLY cheap EV in Europe. Elon please help us.,"Until today, we had classes of cars divided mainly by power of the motor itself, and the price range was according to that. Cheap cars, small motor, very slow going uphill, you are poor, you cant have fun uphill, fine... But you can drive same distance with rich guys at the same time, because you can fuel the car in a very short period of time.

With push to EVs we will be forced to buy almost twice more expensive cars, which will impact mostly the lower income class (east EU), than rich guys like most of you (west EU, americans). There will be no possibility to buy new cars at 9,000$ as today (Dacia, cheap Peugeots, VW Up, Skoda citigo, Hyundai i10), but you have to buy the same chasis but EV which starts at 20,000$. Double the price.

Iam coming from Czechia (west neighbour of Germany), people are mostly buying Skoda's (basically VW little cheaper brother for 90% of the VW price). Average car there is 16 years old. Most of the cars are bought by companies (management) and after 3-5 years companies are selling them to their employees, other main source of cars is import of used cars from Germany (5-10yo) cars and drive them next 10 years. Not many people are buying their own new cars. Poor people here are buying used cars under 4,000$ like a bread. When offer like this appears on the internet, its bought immediately.

Iam wondering what will be people buying as EVs. If you driven whole life combis (wagons are really popular here) and you expect price level 20,000$ for new car (lower middleclass standard) and suddenly only possibility is to buy some small city EV microcar, you will be mad and dissapointed. If you were buying only cheap cars, you will be priced off the market totally...

If you are not buying new, but used, can you imagine the cost of exchange of the batteries? People are used to buy 4000$ car, repair something for 1000$ (brakes, suspension, motor) and drive it next 2 years without any money on maintenance. Now imagine having to pay 6 000$ for a battery swap of used Tesla. Its worth more than car...

**And the most important thing.** Range. In EV, you dont pay mainly for the motor size, but for the range. Do you remember that EV jokes before Tesla? Renault Zoe with 22kWh battery and shitty efficiency? Thats what we have on used market and its 50% more expensive than todays new petrol car.

When you want to go somewhere, you have to charge it on quickchargers which offers electricity 4x more expensive than your home electricity. This was new for me, suddenly all charging companies are rising prices here... You have no choice, you dont have Tesla with 370mi range, you have only like 60miles range and you have to stop every 60 miles (1hour of driving) to charge it for 1 hour. Can you imagine going even 200 miles with this type of cheap car?

Tell me, what can we expect in next 5-10 years of EV cars? Is there any cheap car coming with sufficient range or everything will be **Pay For Range**?

Those are immediately met with ""Maybe one member of a family gave her"". ""Maybe sugar daddy gave her"". ETC.





First of, how come that she never saw anyone in her family charging Tesla? How come, if she has a sugar daddy, she wears such a low-class, terribly looking outfit?






Second, no responsible member of a family would give a car to a dumb person, because she will crash it immediately.





And third, such a dumb person would be causing traffic accidents at every corner, because she is too dumb to understand the rules. She would kill someone or herself. 




There are also some minor arguments that I heard from Tesla drivers. For example that car screams at you that it is electric, when you enter it. And size of a charging port is too small for even the dumbest person to think it is for gas pouring. ETC






I think that what is going on here, is that this blonde is pranking those guys. Although, she is dressed really weird. Almost like they set up the whole thing. (And Tesla drivers go to pumps. Not for gas, but for other things)

In all fairness, the Taycan Turbo S times do appear to increase a little bit during run 8 or 9, but nowhere near to the degree the Model S Performance does. The Model S Performance goes from a bit under 11 seconds to around 15 seconds and the 0-60 goes from under 3 seconds to staying around 6 seconds. 

Really a massive loss of performance. It's an interesting thing to consider with electric cars, as advertised performance is usually quite repeatable with ICEs, so long as the engine doesn't overheat.

262,Starlink and the future of Tesla.,"This is just my opinion, so take it for what it is.

As an owner of a Model 3, the one thing that has always amazed me is the constant updates.  The way that Tesla treats their cars like any other company treats an iterative product, versus the traditional automotive industry that wants you to go out and buy the new model every year.

Car manufacturers have put the LTE modem in their cars, but to get any use out of them they usually pass the cost on to the consumer.  Making you front the bill to your cellular provider to have that premium connectivity.

This is where Tesla set themselves apart, and where other automakers will need another 10 years to catch up.  They decided to front the cost for the LTE connectivity on every car, so that they could:

1. Provide a unified and much better user experience for every car owner.
2. Mine the hell out of that data, to produce new and more innovative releases out of their products.

This data usage is not a fixed cost.  To date, the cost of the data for every individual car is offset by every purchase of autopilot and other future updates that require user data to make those decisions.  Having every car on the road continuously improving their products, offsets whatever cost they are incurring to the cellular provider.  However, as more cars are on the road the greater the cost to Tesla.

We don't know what the actual contract terms are for Tesla for the always on connectivity, one has to think though as more cars end up on the road, the greater this cost will be not only by volume but by the data usage.  As Tesla wants to deliver more data heavy product releases, the less feasible cellular data will be.

This is why I feel Starlink will play a huge role in Tesla's future.  Even though its developed from its sister company, they're doing something that no other auto maker is doing.  Creating their own data pipeline.  If the service delivers on even a fraction of 1/1gpbs connectivity, not only will it greatly reduce the costs to Tesla, but it will allow for a much greater pipeline of data, and new features that haven't even been conceived yet.

So in conclusion to my tangent here, I personally feel that although Starlink has been talked about for home internet, I feel its only a matter of time before we start fully understanding how it will play into the core line of cars Tesla offers.  If this happens, other auto makers will be left scrambling with no other option than to hop on board and use the same service that Starlink provides, but always sitting in the rear view mirror to what Tesla is accomplishing.  

TLDR; If Tesla can use Starlink for their cars, it will only increase the distance between them and everyone else in the auto-industry.  As they will have a data pipeline they own, with far greater speeds than what is currently available, that is usable everywhere.",teslamotors,1581384667,finkledinkle7,3,1,True,2020-02-10
263,Tesla Motors - Australia,"Hi,

I'm looking to get educated on the current state of Tesla Motors in Australia as I am interested in purchasing a Tesla in the future.

Are charging stations common? Are prices meant to be reduced in the near future and for what reason would that be? E.g. would a new factory help with providing Australia with cheaper cars? Are Tesla's predicted to go down in price due to increased competition?

Any information would be appreciated, I am keen to learn more. Thanks.",teslamotors,1581386400,FPL_Fraud,27,1,True,2020-02-10
264,Tips Neededfor Road Trip to Cold Weather Destination,"Taking my first extended road trip in my MR Model 3 to take the family skiing at Angel Fire in New Mexico.

We'll be coming from the DFW area in Texas.  Never really had much exposure to colder climates, and I was just wondering if anyone could offer any tips.

The main reason is from what I gather the resort basically doesn't have anything around it, and the nearest chargers are destination in Taos NM which is like 25 miles away.  

If it's rather cold, say in the 20s or so, how much miles of charge can I expect to lose per day?

I'm also a bit concerned with relying on a destination charger situation in Taos when we arrive and before we depart in the event that it's full, and we have to wait hours to charge up before leaving.

Basically any general tips would be appreciated, and of course, if anyone has any specific tips related to this destination, that would be great.",teslamotors,1581387351,shel311,12,1,True,2020-02-10

We got a few in here and there but they must be in full intercept mode.

The N95’s are hard to get in volume without paying a disgusting price. With family in several Chinese cities I knew to get a head start before they blew off of shelves. We are doing everything we can to get masks to my family members that will have to resume their full time jobs soon.

I need your help because I don’t know anyone else that would have that type of influence / ability.

304,Routing time differences between ABRP and Google Maps,"Hi,

Looking to map out a road trip from the NYC metro area down to the Florida Keys.  (Disclaimer, I don't own a Tesla yet, but planning for the Model Y in the future.) There are some considerable differences between what Waze &amp; Google Maps are suggesting versus the ABRP routing and wanted to know real experiences with it.  

The routes appear to be the same, taking I-95 down all the way, with about 1390 miles of driving.  ABRP has the ""driving portion"" listed as 22:16, with 3:01 for charging, a total of 1 day, 1 hour, and 17 minutes of total time from driveway to driveway.

Google Maps shows 1386 miles of driving, with a total time of 20:42.  This is about 1:30 faster than the driving portion that ABRP suggests, but I don't know what the difference is.

I'm expecting regular breaks in the car anyway, so I'll call the 3:00 for charging a wash, since I can't fill up the tank and use a restroom or buy food/snacks/drinks at the same time.

312,Tesla needs to address their used car problem,"IMO every Tesla needs to have a list of which options it was purchased with and especially a current list of purchased software options searchable by VIN or available to view in a menu which makes it abundantly clear.

I've been in the market to buy a used Tesla for a few months and boy has it been painful.  Dealers have almost no idea what options are available much less which ones that are on that car.  I can usually get some idea from the posted pictures and can guide the seller to take a pic of some area of the car or the MCU to try to get the rest.  But some things are not knowable to my knowledge.  For example, I am hunting for a Model S.  There is no way that I know of to tell is the car has FSD purchased.  It looks identical to EAP in the menus.  Private sellers are usually more helpful but they almost never know if the car is going to retain it's FUSC status etc.

Then we get the recent story of the person that bought used with FSD only to have it removed shortly thereafter.  I've really lost confidence.  I don't know all the details of that story but it sure sounds like the dealer thought it has FSD, and the purchaser thought it had FSD... because at the time it did.  How the hell is it on there if it wasn't purchased for that VIN?  

I don't think this is a small thing.  It severely erodes confidence in buying used and greatly effects resale value for those who buy new.  I'll bet every wholesaler and auction buyer out there is second guessing buying a Tesla.  

I have some sympathy for the traditional dealers trying to understand the very different Tesla but boy are they really, really clueless.  Tesla is also no help.  I've tried calling with a VIN to no avail.  Maybe I'm doing it wrong but resellers don't know how to do it either.

I don’t plan on living here for more than 5 years

It is EXTREMELY sunny in my area, and it hits over 110 Fahrenheit for at least a month in the summer. base rates are .23/kWh and go over .50/kWh, which makes bills of $400/month or more. completely reasonable in the summer just trying to keep a home at 75 degrees.

Looking at the Tesla website, I was quoted $22k for the trade in. As for the M3 LR+ with no extra options on color/tires, using the Tesla financing calculator, my monthly payment would be $296 before considering their savings listed on their website. 

I then went to the Dept of Energy’s vehicle cost calculator that supposedly compares annually operating cost of ownership (includes gas, tires, maintenance, license and insurance). Bottom line is, the tool calculated current annualized costs of $5,428 of the F150 vs $3,104 of the M3 LR+. Assuming this tools is pretty accurate, this translates to an annualized savings of $2,324 or $193 / month. 

Is it too far fetched to say that I’d basically have an effective monthly payment of $103? Has anyone used the Department of Energy’s calculator? Anything I’m missing?",teslamotors,1581473129,abstractart18,123,1,True,2020-02-11

364,HW3 Retrofits in Full Swing: A Midwesterner's Perspective,"My friend and I live in the middle of Missouri and we both had our Model 3's upgraded to HW3 today at the St. Louis service center. When I dropped my car off, there were dozens and dozens of Teslas lined up in multiple rows inside the service center (far more than I had ever seen there before), and the techs confirmed that the majority of them were in for the HW3 upgrade. My upgrade had actually been delayed from an appointment a couple of weeks ago because they were out of a ""visor"" component that is used to shield the HW3 chip from potential moisture drippage off the inside of the windshield. My car was built in August 2018, and apparently Tesla started including the visor a month or two after my car was built, but it has to be added for cars prior to that when installing HW3. After having heard a few horror stories on Reddit that some installs were taking multiple days, I am happy to report that my install only took about 2 hours. The techs informed me they have a guy dedicated to doing nothing else but installing HW3 at the service center all day long.

TL;DR: I live in the heart of the Midwest, far from California or large population centers, and our service center seems to be churning out HW3 retrofits en masse at a rate of about 2 hours a pop, which signals to me that Tesla has worked out the initial installation kinks, and HW3 retrofits are now rolling out to the masses.",teslamotors,1581477116,brandude87,1,1,True,2020-02-11

You're paying for an extra wire that will literally never be used.  If it's close it's not that big of a deal, but if it's not close to the panel it adds up pretty fast.  Copper is expensive.  


The -xx denotes the ampacity.  NEMA 14-30 means it's 2 hots, neutral, ground, and 30 amps.

History: When Teslas first hit the market there was no supercharger network.  NEMA 14-50 was the preferred choice because those plugs can usually be found at RV parks if you had to travel far.  Nowadays 99% of us will never plug in at an RV park.  The 1% who will can always buy a NEMA 14-50 adapter later.",teslamotors,1581489855,SnarkySparkyIBEW332,15,1,True,2020-02-12

380,Tesla Costa Mesa Service Center Review,"SO DISAPPOINTED!

I took my Model 3 into the Costa Mesa Service Center to fix a rattle that Burbank tried to fix twice.

After pulling up, I wandered around for 10 min., not knowing where to check in, until I was finally told to wait in my car.

After another 20 minutes of waiting in my car, Dan came to my window.  I explained the rattling and asked if he could check the brake fluid and let me know if it needs to be changed and fix the rattle.  He drew up the paperwork and it's $195 for the fluid flush and $97.50 to fix the rattle.  I asked, ""Isn't the rattle covered by warranty?""  He says, ""Well we just put a cost for labor down in case we find out it was due to outside forces like rats nibbling on wires or something.""  ""But isn't this a carry-over from what the Burbank Service Center couldn't fix?"" I asked.  Then he started a word salad about the California Lemon Law and how if an issue isn't fixed by the fourth time you have the right to return the vehicle.  That's why they put a labor cost on the estimate.  (I am assuming so it looks like a new problem instead of an existing one.)  ""So you put down a cost to get around that law?"" I asked.  His next answer was like a politician deflecting a question, about how they are the hub for Tesla repairs and they get hundreds of cars a week, and they have experienced people there.  I had to stop him from going on with his non-answer and said, ""When I took it into Burbank, they had this zeroed out both times.""  He explained then that he always tried to side with the customer when it comes to warranty issues.  He wants his customers to have a good experience and because it's only $100 he has no problem eating the cost.

It had been 2 hours at this point, so I signed and left.

After two days, my car was ready and because I had to work, my wife to picked up my car.

Her experience was the same as mine.  She parked and wandered around until someone told her to wait.  After 30 minutes of waiting, someone came out and asked, ""Who's next?""  She looked around at the other people waiting, and since no one knew who was next, she stood up and said, ""I think it's me.""

She told me after that they charged her $300 and I asked for the receipt.  She said they didn't give her one.  I then tried to look at the estimate they had emailed me to sign, but when I clicked the ""review and sign"" link, I was greeted with a ""This document has already been signed,"" message, with no option to download.  I hadn't received any invoices via email, or via the Tesla app either.  I called the Service Center but there was no answer, so I left a message.

The next day I received a text from Dan saying I'll get a survey and if he didn't get 5 stars, to contact him.

I replied that I never received notification I would be charged and would like to see the receipt.

Dan sends me the invoice and I see I was charged for the fluid flush and the rattling.

I text him back:

""So I was charged for the rattling? That wasn't a warranty issue?""

He responds:

""Yes. You were charged $97.50 for the rattle. This was not a warranty repair. Rattles and squeaks are only covered for the first 6 months of ownership.""

I respond:

""You told me I would only be charged if it was due to outside forces like rats. You mentioned nothing about 6 months. Was what you told me when I signed the document untrue?""

After 2 days with no response, I text:

""Hey Dan, I'm looking for a response to my last question.""

He has yet to respond.

The Costa Mesa Service Center seems unorganized, uncaring, and it feels like your typical shady car shop.

This was my wife's first experience with Tesla.  After months of trying to convince her to trade in her Mercedes SUV for a Model Y, she flatly rejected it saying, ""I don't want to have to take my car to that shop.  Tesla's service is so bad.""",teslamotors,1581499184,Latter-barracuda,38,1,True,2020-02-12

396,Day 1: Delivery Delayed due to Technical Error,"So, today at 11am I was supposed to receive my Performance Model 3. I’ve anxiously waited the few months it took to get it built exactly the way I wanted it. My kids know about it and are just as anxious. Last night, they asked me if I could drive them to school in it in the morning, I said “no because we don’t get it until tomorrow at 11am, but I’ll pick you up in it!” They shouted “yeaaaaaaahh yah” and celebrated.

Fast forward to today’s call at 9:30am where the girl calls me and tells me my vehicle has “the same issue again and she is not authorized to release the vehicle with a warning light on it until it is properly addressed” just as robotic as it sounds reading it...

“The same issue again!?”

This is literally the first call I’ve received about the delivery of my vehicle at all, and the 1st call is to tell me my car is broken, for a second time, and not only am I not getting it today, we have no idea when I will be getting it.

Apparently I’m in limbo “until the engineers wake up in California” that’s literally what I was told.

409,The WORST Tesla mobile experience I've had.,"I realized a couple weeks ago that my glovebox light wouldn't come on when the glovebox was opened. I had just watched a YouTube video on how someone had the same issue and the mobile service couldn't fix it because it was a harnessing issue (it had to be taken to the shop instead), but I decided to give mobile service a shot anyways. I mad my appointment, was sent a text the next day for an earlier appointment, so I took it.

The service tech arrived and began working on the glovebox. He took apart the entire thing and all the surrounding trim pieces. He then put the whole thing back and realized it was all hooked up correctly and that it must be a harnessing issue. So he told me to make another service appointment to actually take the car in. But before he left, I realized the glovebox was completely misaligned. The bottom left of the glovebox door was not aligned properly it looked completely out of place. I have examined my car thoroughly many times and always keep an eye out for what looks out of place, so I know what my glovebox looked like before he started. Mind you, it was like 6 pm at this time and he was working with a small light. So I brought it to his attention and at first he looked at it with a pause, ran his hand across it, and said ""this is normal. I service 100s of cars a month and I would consider this normal."" I told him that I believed him, but that I know what my glovebox looked like before and that there was no way it looked like that. He kept pushing that its was normal, so I dug in to my camera roll and found a picture of the dash wrap I had installed where my glovebox was in the picture. He looked at it and said ok I can open it and put it back together again.

So he took apart the whole glovebox again. I was sitting in the driver seat at this point but on my phone. I noticed he was extremely aggressive with all the pieces. He went on to explain that it couldn't have been installed incorrectly, because the pins that hold it up wouldn't have gone in correctly. He put the whole thing back and said ""that's the best I can get it. I can make a note that you weren't happy with the re-install and the service center can see if they can fix it for you."" But he kept saying that's the best I can do. He even said ""I don't even know what to touch to fix what you're asking me to fix even if I thought it needed fixing."" All-in-all he was super dismissive, and I hadn't even gotten my original problem fixed!

The next morning I went to look at the glovebox in daylight and found a list of issues that really pissed me off.

1. The glovebox door was filthy. Scuffs and smudges all over.
2. The trim piece on the bottom was literally bent and out of place.
3. The glovebox didn't open all the way/properly.
4. There was a puncture in the leather piece on the side of the center storage trim (where the passengers left thigh would be up against).
5. And of course, the light still didn't work.

I have made another service appointment and am going to express my frustration with them. Hopefully they can get it all fixed and this won't happen to any of you!

Tesla needs to take service more seriously. It's unfortunate that such an amazing brand with amazing products is brought down by horrible service.

Specifically, the car forgets which direction it is facing, and Smart Summon taking longer to engage?  Kind of like it is ignoring Summon Standby?

The 2nd issue isn't too bad, but the top one is harsh because, while the patching is correct, because the car cannot remember which direction it was facing, Smart Summon starts driving in the wrong direction.

HOWEVER, the PDF doesn't reflect this math, and it is carried over throughout the remainder of the tax forms.  So, this has a direct impact on my 5695, which is the solar array tax credit.  If the math on 4936 is wrong (Where 7,500 is not being multiplied by whatever you're allowed, be it 100, 50 or 25%), then that amount is not available for use in the solar array section.

3,Culture as a Critical Factor in Reception of Tesla Vehicles,"I'm a soon to be M3 SR+ owner, but have been haunting many different Tesla fan/owner sites and forums for many years now. I'm also an expat and have noticed a distinct difference in the opinions of Tesla's vehicles between the English speaking Tesla fan community and the native language Tesla fan community of the country I live. 

For example, when individuals come here to ask about purchasing a Tesla, I would argue, very objective advice is given. Folks try to give these potential owners all the facts, both positive and negative, but are generally supportive and encouraging. The other community tends to be negative. Telling people not to purchase a Tesla and listing all of their issues and complaints. Summarizing their experience as, ""only if you really love the car and willing to put up with its unreliability and faults should you buy it. Otherwise it is not worth it."" It is very disheartening and makes me question my decision. However, as soon as I come to the English speaking sites, I feel reassured about my order.

My conclusion is that culture is a very critical in understanding how Tesla vehicles are perceived and evaluated. I would argue that in this culture, these owners are coming from other high end luxury vehicles (BMW, Audi, Lexus) and expect Teslas to perform at the same level if not better because it too is a luxury brand so they tend to be more critical and perhaps even don't see the forest for the trees.

13,Tesla - Excellent cars absolute worst possible customer service.,"New Tesla model 3 owner as of only December here. A quick review of Yelp informed me I was not alone with this experience so figured I would take it to reddit.

I am absolutely shocked at the blatant disregard of their customer's satisfaction with the buying and owning process. 

Bought the car online as no dealers are in my state, believe it or not I had a few questions along the way. Email communication net about a 25% Tesla reply rate. Of those replies approximately 50% of my questions would be answered averaging about 2 questions in an email. Couldn't bulk email as I would either think of a new question or have a follow up to their vague answer.

Attempted text, while reply rate was better at approx 50% usually the response had nothing to do with my question. When calling the number provided over text the sales associate told me ""either buy it or don't"".

Preemptively ordered a charging adapter- So I could charge my car(important right?). Was informed it would arrive on X date   which was 2 days after I was expected to take delivery. Day before I went to take delivery checked the status and the shipper had yet to receive the item. I contacted service 3 times to either expedite or cancel. You guessed it, 0% reply rate. The item arrived a week later. Fortunately Tesla had one in stock at my pick up location. I only had to wait in the service line for an hour. Fortunately my delivery appointment was well behind schedule so I only needed to wait another hour. Now I have two....

Finally the rep refused to fill dealership rebate paperwork out for me and told me he would email the  paperwork. I called the state rebate program who informed me the dealership was aware and had to complete it. I have been attempting to resolve this at about a 10% reply rate. I'll be calling. It is likely I will miss the rebate window and this will end up in small claims.

The car itself. Holy hell it's awesome. Impressed by something new everyday. The customer service itself though leaves much to be desired. I'm beginning to regret the decision due to lack of support.

Add a new toggle on the Navigation Settings screen:

On/Off **Mute** **Navigation** **on Home/Work Commute**  
(i) Temporarily mute navigation audio cues when commuting between Home and Work locations.

I think calling the feature ""Mute on Commute"" or ""Commute Mute"" could be clever too.

**Justification**

The Automatic Navigation feature is nice, especially during trips. However, for normal commutes between Work and Home (and vice versa) I do not need the audio directions for obvious reasons and it interrupts other commute listening items like morning news, podcasts, talk radio, etc.  I find myself muting Navigation audio cues for my commute and then when I go somewhere besides Work/Home, I have to drill into the settings and unmute them. 

It should only “source” the setting when you start a commute between Home/Work, so if for some reason you re-enable the audio cues during your commute, it stays on for the duration of that trip. ",teslamotors,1578540157,hergio,9,1,True,2020-01-08

I laughed it off and it keeps bugging me because he was arrogant and the other rep was boasting about having a stealth that he scored which was like salting the wound, but I go no answer and not even an attempt to give me legitimate feedback.

54,Quick way to toggle between CREEP and HOLD stopping modes,"Ever since the HOLD stopping mode (a.k.a one pedal driving) was introduced recently, I've been really enjoying it, but there's one use case where I've been finding it less than ideal: getting out of my driveway.

Explanation: my house is hidden behind a couple other homes, and we all share a single driveway (easement) that takes us back to a fairly small square ""maneuvering area"" that all of our garages face. To get out, I usually have to back out of my garage and do at least a 6 point turn to position my car at the right angle to make it through the corner and down the driveway.

**tl;dr** \- things are pretty tight when I'm trying to maneuver out of my driveway, and this is where I miss CREEP. When speeds are low, distances are short, and maneuvers are tight, you really want to optimize for ease of stopping -- in other words, I want to have my foot hovering over the brake pedal, instead of having to switch between the brake and accelerator. But as soon as I'm out onto normal roads, HOLD becomes a more enjoyable experience, hence this feature request.

99,“Require lane change confirmation” useless?,"It seems when I have navigate on autopilot set to requiring confirmation (via signaling with the stalk) it works well and the car only bothers me intermittently to adjust the steering to stay active 

When I remove the requirement for lane change confirmation . It seems that, no matter what interval I have just recently “adjusted the steering” to tell the car to leave me alone and go back to autopilot, EVERY SINGLE TIME it recommends a lane change, it IMMEDIATELY LIGHTS UP BLUE again requiring a steering adjustment for Navigate on Autopilot to stay active. It will not make the turn until I pull the steering wheel to dismiss that warning

This in essence, turns this function into a more annoying version of “requiring lane change confirmation” the car is prompting me for a lane change, and instead of making me hit the turn signal, it’s making me turn the wheel

I know what some will say “it’s just a coincidence, it’s prompting you to touch the wheel at the same intervals as the other mode” — this is completely false. It does not matter how recently I have “jerked the wheel” to dismiss the notification- if the car prompts for a lane change 2 seconds later, it takes the standard 3 seconds or so to signal, and before making the turn it lights up blue requiring me to touch the wheel. I have driven the car on autopilot for two months — not once has NoA changed lanes for me WITHOUT requiring me to jerk the wheel when set to not needing lane change confirmation—- which completely defeats the entire purpose of the mode 

Second rant- it requires you to touch the wheel WAY TOO often. It also defeats the purpose. I also loathe that instead of it being touch capacitive, or a button I can push, it actually requires me to jerk the wheel pretty hard, to the point where I sometimes disengage autopilot altogether. I’ll build up and do it slowly, increasing my strength each time so as not to trigger it, and on the third time it actually shuts it off. 

There has to be a better way of the car taking in input that communicates I’m alert and paying attention, that is better than literally turning the wheel way from the direction it’s intended to be going in, which doesn’t even seem safe, especially when you’re going 75 on the highway on a turn. 

What am I doing wrong? Am I missing an easy way Around this? I love navigate on autopilot but the way the car functions now, I opt to keep it on the standard “require lane change confirmation “ because it’s ostensibly the same functionality. I want the car to just weave through traffic on the highway without me constantly pulling the steering wheel before every single lane change even if they are like 5 seconds apart",teslamotors,1578589112,Luso7,36,1,True,2020-01-09

105,Early Model 3 Deliveries: Purchase vs Lease,"I recently read an article about why people don’t see many Model 3s on the resale market. It used data and spoke about people’s love for the car, and their % of recommendation. Anyone who owns or has driven and is working towards one, the latter of which I am, would agree with the article. 

However, one of the comments on the article raised a great point. How many of the early purchases in 2018 were leases vs purchases. Which in 2021 means we could see a slew on Model 3s appearing on the resale market. 

So 3 questions. 

1. Early delivery receivers of Model 3 did you purchase or lease?

2. What do you think Tesla would set their resale price at? I saw a dealership selling an SR+ for more than a new one. 

3. What are the pros and cons of waiting for these leases to come up? And would you purchase one?

109,More transparent and/or user controlled battery pre-conditioning in cold climates,"I know there's a few other threads about similar things... but I haven't seen one with exactly this wording.

---

##Request
User controllable manual pre-conditioning of battery during cold weather events. (Bonus would be to rework Scheduled Departure to automatically build in pre-conditioning)
It would be great if all models (including SR+ and LEMR Model 3's) had an option to have the vehicle pre-conditioned in cold weather.

Note: There should be different settings for if owners are affected by different time of use charges for the electricity. I live in an area where we pay the same rate no matter what time of day, so this I don't have any concerns about the timing of charging the battery and heating it.
---

##Problem
I live in a colder climate (projected to have highs next week in the -30C/-22F's) and park our Model 3 in a detached and unheated garage. The car is plugged in each night into a HPWC connected to a 50A breaker. (We have a Model 3 LEMR so we're capped at 32A of charging). Until Scheduled Departure was released, I had the following schedule set up in TeslaFi:

| Date | Time | Command |
|--------|:-------|-------:|
| Mon-Fri  | 06:00  | Set Charge Limit to 90% and Start Charging  | 
| Mon-Fri  | 06:50  | Turn on cabin heat (if at home)  | 
| Mon-Fri  | 07:10  | Turn off cabin heat (if at home)  | 
| Sun-Thur  | 12:00  | Set Charge Limit to 80%  | 

This allowed us to have better available regen in the morning and the cars efficiency in traffic was slightly better (as the battery wasn't still being warmed on the commute). It wasn't great, but it was better. It's also not great because as temperatures fluctuated the time to go from 80-90% also were affected.

Queue Scheduled Departure being released. At first I was excited and told my wife that this will remove our worries about having to warm the battery on the commute... I couldn't have been more wrong. The first day we used it (and I had TeslaFi disabled), the car had almost no regen available at the start of her commute. After some digging I found that while we have the car scheduled to leave at 7AM, the battery is hard coded to finish charging by 6AM (I think due to time of use charging rates in California?). Looking into TeslaFi I found that the battery is constantly done charging by ~5:30AM when using scheduled departure and then the cold is allowed to sink in.

Manually turning on Climate Control appears to be a good solution as well, however letting it run for 30 minutes before we leave still hasn't had a dramatic increase on our available regen on cold days.

##TLDR

There's no current effective way to have the battery pre-conditioned properly for a road trip in cold weather. (Even when plugged into the HPWC and with the battery charged to the set limit).",teslamotors,1578592965,TheKrs1,14,1,True,2020-01-09
110,Convoy Mode,"Now that we have a LOT of Tesla's on the road, I wonder if we could consider a Convoy Mode. Here are my thoughts:

\- Would only work when lead car is on NoA/FSD

\- For following cars, it would increase efficiency with drafting but also turning off some sensors as they will rely on the leading car to do all the FSD work. With Tesla Semi coming out soon, this would make even more sense. I read on wiki that efficiency could be up to 39% for cars behind a Truck. 

\- Increase safety as cars would work in harmony so if anything happens to the lead car, it would take into account the length of the convoy (e.g. change lanes, reduce speed etc...). The lead car could even rely on other car camera and sensors to take decisions. This could also be used as a ""contingency"" mode where any component of a car FSD (camera, sensors, computer etc..) is damaged during a trip and having a lead car to ""show"" the way would be a cool back up plan. 

\- Would be super useful information for Boring Company. One option was to have cars in tunnel driving in FSD mode. This mode would allow for more data to be collected when multiple cars are using the road more efficiently

I have owned electric vehicles since 2011, so understand that the miles one get are completely dependent on the driving conditions (style, weather, terrain, blah, blah) but on a full charge, a relatively new car generally displays close to the advertised mileage.

Probably mileage number doesn't mean anything, but I couldn't find any up to date data about the size of the battery on M3 LRD, these are few references I looked at, but those are from 2017, when Tesla had options like SR, SR+, MR, LR, etc.

&gt;  
&gt;Tesla was already able to advertise the range of the Long Range Model 3 at 325 miles, but they chose not to — presumably in order to be able not to advertise the range of the less expensive version as being longer than the more expensive dual motor and performance versions, which are not seeing the same range increase even though they use the same battery pack.

If the battery difference between LRD and SR model isn't much then I would opt for the SR (or the less expensive option as Electrek folks chose to say :-)), as AWD is not a deciding factor for me, but a long-range definitely I care for.

In the Pacific North West the rain changes quite a lot, sometimes it's misty sometimes it's very heavy. DeepRain simple doesn't handle most of them properly. The rain has to be of a very specific kind, during daylight, for it to work properly.

Especially at night on highways without lights, heavy rain or snowfall is quite stressful when the wipers simply don't come on while going 80+km/h with no visibility. And when there are people sitting in the back, the car often shows incorrect seatbelt warnings, which cover the wiper settings button. Anyone who drives the car has to be specifically trained to FIRST press the wiper button, and THEN switch to the screen and tap the correct area. People often tap the wrong button when the car hits a small bump or something and ends up turning the wipers off instead. It's extremely cumbersome and is ruining an otherwise perfect driving experience.

It has been very unsafe dealing with this situation. I really hope this is addressed.

It all began when I realized I was forgetting my keys to my house and office, as I no longer needed my car key. I thought nothing of this but it started to get worse. A few days later I forgot that my wife's car didn't automatically stay within the highway lanes and adjust to the flow of traffic. Other little symptoms showed up like assuming all cars are just ""on"" all the time... this is not the case. Most cars do not just warm-up and play my NPR when I get in.. 

Now, these were all minor symptoms, the real symptom came about this morning when my wife's new Jeep wouldn't start! It was dead, it cease to exist. How can this be? It's brand new and there should be no reason it died overnight unless we left a door open or light on. I remember that I had driven it the night before and specifically had clicked the key fob lock button twice (because I have walked away several times assuming it locked itself..) learning my lesson. Then it dawned on me, I hadn't left the door open or a light on. I flat out left the car on and walked away, leaving the car on and running all night!! I have been so used to just walking away from my car and having it turn lock and turn off that I had completely forgotten to turn off my wife's car...

I always keep the distance set to 3 or 4 car lengths. As is, when the car in front slows, the Tesla slows as well, to keep the same set distance. 

What if Tesla had a dynamic distance setting for instances like this. Going full speed you keep the distance. If there is a sudden hard break the car can adjust from 4 to 3 or 2 car lengths, giving your rear end a bit more of a buffer. When traffic goes to a crawl it can go to 1 distance so you don't keep an awkward 4 car distance going 10 mph.

Then it can go backwards when you accelerate, and when you hit certain speeds it will go back from 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4 etc.

Once your batteries are low, you drive up to a station and replace a new battery with your used one and you return the used one for it to be charged and used for someone else. Renting batteries if you will. It will take 5 mins if there are specialized machines to make quick swaps. You pay a set amount for the electricity and labor.

200,Help me understand the math,"Hi reddit.

-

I currently drive approximately 50,000 miles per year in a f250 Diesel and i'm considering putting an order in on the cybertruck.

-

I don't particularly ""like"" the design of a Cybertruck, as it isn't really functional for a lot of the truck things i do (Can't put ladder racks on it, can't tow a fifth wheel). So i'd have to keep the diesel truck as well.

-

However, i'm looking hard at what my savings would be if i figured out a way to put the bulk of those miles on a Cybertruck instead of the diesel.

-

So, here's the math on the diesel side:


50,000 miles per year at 14.5 miles per gallon = 3448 gallon of diesel at $3.00 per gallon on average (estimated) = $10,344 in fuel costs, yearly.

-

Further, according to most things i read, charging is going to cost me approximately $0.041 per mile.


50,000 * 0.041 = $2,050 in yearly charging costs.

-

This would be a yearly savings of $8,294 for me, if i've done the math correctly. Over the 6 year lifespan of a vehicle, this translates into $49,764 in fuel savings.

-

The first update was 2019.36.x and 2019.40.x at the same time und a few days ago the big ""christmas"" update. Now I know that the German/EU version of the Tesla software is not always the same as the US version, e.g. smart summon was only released with the latest update and not with V10 in september. That can happen due to regulatory issues or simple differences between countries. The same is true for the FSD visualizations, I get it, that traffic lights work and look differently in Germany. I don't have a problem with that, I'm patient.

With all that said, the German ""patch notes"" make no mention of the 5 % power increase that was released with 2019.36.x in the US. Does this mean that we didn't get that upgrade?

I can't test it, because I never bothered to really measure the performance of my car, but I really wish I knew if the power increase was left out in Germany or the EU for some reason.

209,A new level of interaction with content in Tesla,"There is a new great solution for owners of the TESLA cars which allows you to conveniently view video content from YouTube.

When traveling long distances and standing in traffic jams, Tesla drivers now use various gadgets to view news and entertainment content: smartphones, tablets, laptops. This is inconvenient, makes it difficult to move and interferes with the view, which is distracting and can create unpleasant situations on the road.

Software developers for Tesla, in the 10th firmware, gave drivers the opportunity to watch video content from resources: YouTube, Netflix and Hulu.

But not without restrictions:

1. Content can only be viewed while the car is parked;
2. The video opens completely to the full screen, which eliminates the use of other applications (such as maps);
3. The solution works on cars produced since may 2018;

To solve these issues there is an excellent tool: it is the AVEDI Service.

It is designed as an aggregator of videos from various popular online platforms, which will allow drivers and passengers to enjoy watching videos on the built-in large screen of the car, thereby brightening up the time spent both waiting and on the road.

You can already download the app in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/avedi/id1492815728)

243,Sentry Mode didn't capture two recent incidents,"Over the last couple weeks, I've had the very rotten luck of finding bad scratches when coming back to my parked car.

Here's one that I found on my back left bumper:

[https://imgur.com/a/x2axXhu](https://imgur.com/a/x2axXhu)

I have had Sentry Mode on, so no problem... right? Unfortunately, I combed through all the footage and couldn't find anything on the actual incident. 

I'm pretty confident with regards to *when* and *where* it happened, and I think I also know which car did it. Sentry Mode had recorded a super sketchy person looking into my car for valuables, and in those videos, I saw that a car was parked no more than an inch behind my bumper. Not even sure how that driver managed to squeeze in behind me (and then get out later).

[https://imgur.com/a/prT0n2n](https://imgur.com/a/prT0n2n)

This is obviously not evidence that it was that car that did it.

I'm very surprised that Sentry Mode didn't capture the following: (1) the scrape incident, (2) the act of this car parking so close to me, (3) the act of this car pulling out (even if it wasn't the one that hit my car).

Separately, I found a scrape on the front right bumper too that Sentry failed to capture, so now I'm questioning whether I actually understand how Sentry Mode works. I understand that Sentry Mode is in beta (isn't the whole car in beta?), but I would've thought an impact this significant would've definitely triggered it.

256,Two-fingers swipe on bottom left side of screen to control wiper's speed.," This one I think it's a bit easy to implement and does not seem to impact any other functions:

If you touch the screen where the Wiper button region is (regardless what type of card is being displayed) with two fingers and slide left or right, you control the wiper's speed from off to auto.

This already works with HVAC temperature and volume, but with one finger and at very specific points on the screen. So using two fingers at said region would specify that you want to control wipers, not change screen.

It would be better if you would do this straight over the vehicle zone (I don't know the name of the left region), but the two fingers function is already associated to zoom, even if this is not very useful.

Or if you could do a three-fingers gesture anywhere on the screen and it will control the wipers.

Reasons:

1. Sorry Tesla, but your neural artificial whatever wiper technology is still not good enough. My car still thinks it needs to clean a crispy clean windshield and I can only stop it form the screen.
2. Under my control, the last thing I want is to distract myself on a busy highway to find where do I turn these damn wipers off. Or on. Or whatever it is that it is supposed to do but isn't.
3. The button on lever is sporadically helpful, but then it starts thinking the world is flooding when all is fine.

But, given I have a number of other hungry power devices in the house (including a Powerwall) I need to be careful that my overall house draw doesn’t exceed 100 amps because that would blow the utility company’s main fuse and leave me blacked out for days while I begged them to fix it!

Each charger has its own 32 amp supply and is currently totally independent. Would it help if I added the load sharing comms cable? I’m not sure this will really achieve anything, would it?

Auto park rarely detects an open spot, and I’m usually much faster to back in then the number of moves the car needs. Enhanced summon is an unreliable party trick at best. Navigate on autopilot isn’t worth the price of FSD since you get most of the functionality with what’s included in autopilot. I also brought my car into service once and inquired about HW3 at the same time. Was told that they’d start upgrading sometime for eligible owners, but that I wouldn’t be proactively notified by Tesla and that I should keep calling in and checking (wtf?)

In retrospect, probably should have either

(1) bought Tesla stock with the money I spent on FSD (especially a year ago before the insane run up as of late). By the time FSD is actually ready the investment will probably be able to net a new Tesla.

314,Left without any transportation because of a blow out on the highway in a loaner. TLDR at bottom.,"I dropped my car off for service on Monday. The repair was scheduled to be completed on Wednesday. By Thursday the repair was still not completed, and I was informed the car would need to be held over the weekend. At this point I asked for a loaner, so that I could have transport over the weekend. My sister in law is visiting from outside the country and it would be nice to take her site seeing. Everything seemed to be going according to plan until tonight.

While I was taking an interchange ramp from one freeway to another, the front passenger tire had a blow out. I was able to safely recover control and drive slowly down the ramp onto the shoulder of the freeway. Once safely parked on the shoulder I proceeded to call Tesla’s road side assistance. This is where the real fun begins.

The road side assistance person informed me that according to their system they had no record of my loaner. They said they could not provide me a replacement tire, they could not provide us any other form of transportation. All they would do was tow the loaner back to the service center. Effectively reclaiming their car that “I shouldn’t have”. The recommendation they gave me was for us to walk across multiple lanes of traffic (with luggage in tow) and call an Uber from a safe location.

In the end I had to ask a friend to pick up my wife and sister in law, because I had to wait on the tow truck. Afterwards I sat in the car and waited over an hour for the tow truck driver. Then I took an Uber 20 miles home. 

I’m still in shock from the lack of support and ineptitude of the situation. As presently I am without any form of transportation, and probably will remain this way until the service center opens again on Monday. This is not how I wanted my sister in laws vacation to start. This was and still is a horrible experience that no customer should have to go through. Hopefully posting this will garner some attention as no one at Tesla seemed willing to care what they were putting us through.

TLDR: Car is in for service; service is taking longer than expected; got a loaner; loaner had blow out; Tesla says I don’t have a loaner; Tesla towed loaner away effectively leaving us stranded on the shoulder of the freeway; can’t contact service center till Monday.",teslamotors,1578732836,ncklboy,181,1,True,2020-01-11

Overnight, I got this temperature curve (blue is inside temperature and yellow is outside temperature in the garage).

Does anyone know what the car is doing? It also went from 88% to 84% battery with sentry enabled.

My next car is going to be a Model Y (would be my first Tesla) - I am however guessing the prices will go down once they increase their throughput and get rid of the import taxes in EU thanks to GF4 (not to mention that Germany might give tax breaks to Tesla). This is however an uneducated guess from my side since I'm not an expert. 

The best obvious solution in my view is not to pre-order and wait, but I'm really want the model Y and I am just wondering if Tesla will be affordable by 2021.

371,How you can optimize your Tesla experience by analyzing your historic driving &amp; charging data,"With this post I want to show you how you can understand the data of your Tesla, how you can access it yourself and what you can make out of it to improve your Tesla experience. A shorter version of this post is summarized in this video [https://youtu.be/q77eGQGOV2Y](https://youtu.be/q77eGQGOV2Y).

Especially in the first months of owning a Tesla, there might be a lot of questions that will arise regarding the ranges you can achieve and the energy consumption of your car in general. For example:

* **How does the battery degrade over time?** 
* **How much power did I loose overnight while the car was parking in the garage not charging?**  
* **How much energy do I gain through regenerative braking?** 
* **What was the energy consumption of my last rides?** 

The official Tesla app can give you insights into your momentary state of your car. However, at this point of time it offers only limited information regarding your driving and charging history. In this reddit post I want to show you how you can answer these questions yourself for your Tesla, by either using a data tracking service like Teslametric or by fetching the data yourself. The video above gives an overview of both approaches. I reached out to Teslametric to learn about this matter and there is no sponsorship. There are also other trackers on the market (TeslaFi, Teslastics, ..) but I don’t have any experience with them. If you do, let me know in the comments below!  
If you want to play around with raw data yourself, the rest of this post will help you to get started. There are four questions I want to address:

1. **What information can you access?** 
2. **How can you get access to the data?** 
3. **What security aspects should you be aware of?** 
4. **Will frequently accessing your car’s data affect battery drain?** 

Every Tesla is connected to the internet and continuously sends data to Tesla’s own servers - as long as network coverage is available or the car is connected through WiFi. The standard connectivity package, which is included with every Tesla, is sufficient to record and access your data through the Tesla API. In fact, the official Tesla app uses the same API as well to display information to you.  
   
**1. What information can you access?**

You can receive realtime information about your car’s current state. There are a lot of attributes you can access, here are only a few that might be relevant to understand your energy consumption better: 

* GPS location 
* Speed 
* Battery level 
* Estimated Range 
* Odometer 
* Current state of charge 
* Outside temperature 
* Battery heater 
* .. 

Have a look at the full attribute list [here](https://tesla-api.timdorr.com/vehicle/state/data).

**2. How can you get access to the data?**

A lot of the data that a Tesla produces can be accessed through an API. There is no official API documentation but there is unofficial API documentation: 

* [https://www.teslaapi.io/](https://www.teslaapi.io/)
* [https://tesla-api.timdorr.com/](https://tesla-api.timdorr.com/)

You can access the API with token-based authentication. When you generate a token, you will receive an access token and a refresh token. The access token can be used to authorise access to the data. It expires automatically after 45 days. The refresh token can be used to request a new access token after the old one expired. After you generated a token, you won't need your Tesla username and password from this point on to access data. If you need help getting started with the API and you get stuck with the documentation, here is a [technical tutorial from Jimmy Huang](https://medium.com/@jhuang5132/a-beginners-guide-to-the-unofficial-tesla-api-a5b3edfe1467) which might help. After you have created a token, you can start to poll data from a Tesla remotely.

**3. What security aspects should you be aware of?**

The most important thing you have to know is that whoever has access to your car through the API can not only read information but also perform actions on your car. This is not trivial because your car can be unlocked through the API. So what can you do?

***Activate “PIN to Drive""***

The first thing you can do is to activate the feature ""PIN to Drive"" in your Tesla. This way nobody can drive away with your Tesla. To activate it go to your Tesla’s touchscreen and select -&gt; Controls -&gt; Safety and Security -&gt; ""PIN to Drive"" and follow the setup instructions.

***Evaluate the service you plan to use***

You can add an additional security layer by only using services that while offering reading functionalities (GET requests) do not offer to perform actions on your car (POST requests). If a service offers to perform actions, it should at the very least offer Two-Factor Authentication in my opinion.

***Revoke access***

If you gave a token to someone to do some data analysis for you and you want to revoke the access, simply change your [Tesla.com](http://tesla.com/) password, this will invalidate all tokens immediately.

Dear Tesla, if you read this, please consider to add tokens which only grant read access. This way, users, who only want to access their data but don’t want any actions to be performed, have an easier way to eliminate security concerns.  
**4. Will accessing your car’s data frequently affect battery drain?**

Be aware of energy efficiency when making API calls, especially during parking. A Tesla has an energy saving mode called *sleep mode* that allows it to conserve battery power when it is not in use. If you read data while the car is parked, it might not enter this mode. Here is what I learned about how Teslametric solves this problem:  
After you parked your car (while it is not charging), Teslametric will wait for your Tesla to enter sleep mode first before it makes any requests. If you make API calls beforehand, sleep mode might not be entered and your battery drain might increase. During sleep mode, energy is saved but no data can be collected. However, you can ask the status of sleep mode without waking up the car, Teslametric does that every 45 seconds. At the end of your parking event when you start your next trip, it is still recorded how much energy was lost. Based on your trip history, Teslametric predicts when you will drive the car and poll data more frequently when there is a high likelihood you will go on a trip. If you don't do this prediction, in the worst case the first 45 seconds of your trip will not be recorded.

  
I hope this guide has been helpful. If you want to see the full interview with the founder of Teslametric, you can watch it here: [https://youtu.be/LUWQ\_7s3eDE](https://youtu.be/LUWQ_7s3eDE)

Let me know what you want to do with the data and what experiences you have with other services. I’d be happy to learn more!

373,Future Tesla Price Points? (Should I buy a Model 3 now or wait a few years?),"Hey Tesla Community!

So I am a grad student who is graduating in the coming months and would love to buy a Model 3.

I will be living at home with a good paying job, some debt, but will be living at home. Financially, buying a Model 3 could make sense. Regardless, a new car is necessary as my previous car is on its last legs.

I also would not mind waiting a few years to purchase a Model 3 and leasing a different car for the time being. But I can’t help but feel that leasing for a few years would basically be wasting payments that I could have made toward my Model 3.

Also, I’m a little bit concerned that the future price points of Tesla vehicles may increase by the time my lease would end. After all, if the self-driving feature vastly improves in the next 3 years (which it likely will) along with the possibility of the Tesla Robotaxi Network (an unknown), I’m worried the price will greatly increase. Elon Musk himself basically said that once the Tesla Network goes live the company’s financial incentive is to undercut Uber and Lyft by operating in their space. There will be less of an incentive to produce cheap vehicles. 

In addition, Tesla updates their vehicles so that owning one for a long period of time seems reasonable, especially since Elon Musk started that the vehicles are “appreciating assets” due to the updates. Lastly, being able to participate in the Tesla Network sounds promising and a potential way to make additional money.

Basically, my question probably boils down to: if I don’t buy a Model 3 now and lease another vehicle instead, will I come to regret it in 3 years?

414,I think M3 demand in France is pretty high (they even raised prices),"So it's pretty unbelievable, there used to be inventory models but there haven't been any in a while. Rumor was that they were starving us to feed Netherlands before subsidies ran out, but you know what? Same thing happened here in France: starting 2020, the €6,000 EV subsidy has been halved to €3,000 for vehicles costing over €45,000. This really sucks because last year you could get a base M3 for €42,600 (after subsidy), but Tesla even increased the base price by €1,000 in late 2019!!! So now the cheapest M3 is €46,600 after subsidy. The mere fact that they increased the price by €1,000 shows that there is a lot of demand IMO, so they thought they could sell for even higher.

This kind of sucks though, because we can't get the $35k model here, even by phone (I tried, they said that model won't be coming to europe). Would be really cool if there was a sub-45k€ model to still be able to benefit from the full EV subsidy this year though. But I guess if there's that much demand, why would they do it right?

Now, most cars have a dedicated rain sensor that prob costs $10. I get that they are trying to limit parts for cost and production complexity but no one says Teslas auto wipers are good so they should take this feedback and add the sensor in future builds. 

Or if they are set on deep rain, give me a toggle, let the button on the left side of the wheel be a slow down/speed up button that trains the neural net. So like, if it’s raining and auto wipers are going to slow, I can press it twice and it will speed up. Press and hold will slow it down. And pressing once will do what it does now, just triggers one wipe.  Enable this and us humans can teach the damn neural net and for all 😄

466,A way to reproduce rattle noises on-demand at service centers,"My new Model X was experiencing a rattling sound from the front passenger door speaker. It would only manifest with some kinds of music or voices—women's voices in particular. (Did a cross-country road trip and listened to an audio book with a female narrator. 18 hours of rattling drove me crazy!)

It turns out that the new Trax app in the latest firmware update is a great way to reproduce these problems on demand. Open the app, crank the volume up (top of the screen), add a instrument &gt; Wind &gt; Ocarina. On the keyboard that pops up, slide over to the C3 octave to the left, and hold down the keys for a [C major chord](https://www.pianochord.org/c-major.html). Every rattling noise in my car became extremely obvious, immediately.

The Service Center's shop foreman was blown away; they used it to reproduce the problem later that day and to prove that they had fixed it. Turned out that it was just a loose speaker assembly; taking it apart and putting it back together again fixed it.

I've heard that you can also reproduce these problems yourself with a Bluetooth phone connection and a tone generator app but the SC folks aren't willing to do that. Reproducing with an app built-in to the car was a huge win.",teslamotors,1578866811,jasondclinton,78,1,True,2020-01-12

It’s almost scary to see how many Tesla fans react to such things. Why do other car fan bases (even the crazy ones like GTR, bmw’s etc) not have such a “cult like” following? It’s almost like Tesla fans are utterly offended if someone isn’t actively pursuing a purchase of a Tesla. And on top of that, they even get offended when Tesla owners also own another car and say they prefer that car over Tesla. It’s like they’re scared for the brand/image to be hurt. They also are in love with the CEO which I’ve never seen car guys be so in love with the CEO of their favorite car brand.

As a background I took my model 3 SR+ up to big bear this weekend.  I charged to 100% at the bottom of the mountain before going up because there is no charging in big bear (that I am aware)....

I got to the hotel at the top of the mountain with 57% battery.  I knew it would drain a lot but felt comfortable at this level as I know the drive down actually gains battery.   In short I did gain about 5% battery over 60 miles which is really impressive.

Well long story short when I woke up the next morning after having my car parked outside overnight my battery was at 42%.  I literally lost 15% batter with it parked in a parking spot overnight.  Temperature was in the high twenties MAYBE low thirties.  I was shocked and not factoring this into my equation at all.  Is this normal?  

I am really nervous as I have another trip planned but this time 2 days.  So do I need to account for 30% battery loss over the 2 nights?  If I found a place to plug in into a standard 120v plug would this have happened?  How can I avoid this?

492,Need Help - Tesla reneged on my $1000 rebate and now won't return my calls.,"I ordered my LR RWD Model 3 in October, 2019.  I ordered a MR RWD on a Tuesday and rushed out to this sub to read all the posts.  I learned that if you called Tesla and changed your order over the phone, there was a limited number of LR RWDs available that were selling for $1000 less than they had been listed previously online (the only LR options listed on the site at that time were AWD and Performance).  So on Wednesday that week, I called and changed my order confirming with Cust Serv that the $1000 discount was real.  I took delivery about 5 weeks later and in those 5 weeks I spoke withe Cust Serv no less than 5 times and on each occasion, I confirmed the $1000 reduction in list price.

On delivery day, my paperwork was not updated to reflect the $1000 discount, but they included a post-it note indicating I was owed $1000 and I was told to take a picture of it for proof.  Apparently the system wouldn't allow for the $1000 discount to be reflected.  So on that day and a week later and a month later, I called Tesla Cust Serv and spoke to all manner of people.  On every occasion they expressed their apologies that it was taking this long and had some version of a story for what had been keyed in wrong or configured wrong or not handled which was holding up the check.  Turns out the issue had to do with a delay in processing my paperwork.  I changed my order on a Wednesday and the promotion ended on that Friday... but Tesla didn't process my order until Saturday, so despite submitting everything and confirming with people along the way, my order went through without the discount.  Months later on a call I was told Tesla has finally gotten things sorted out and that I should have a check in the mail soon... they even confirmed my address for delivery.  About once a month I would call Tesla and walk whoever answered the phone through the saga and they would review my records (including the photo of the post-it note) and give me the latest explanation and promise to get it resolved.  

About 3 months ago, this changed.  I encountered an agent who told me a different story.  They told me that the system was indicating I was never due a discount, so no refund was allowed.  This came via email after explaining the whole situation to the new person I was speaking with.  They had to talk to the folks in CA and get back to me.  I responded explaining the whole saga in writing and expressing how unacceptable their response was... I need to speak with your manager, etc.  No response.

Weeks passed and I called again.  This time, strangely enough, I ended up speaking with the local salesperson who processed my paperwork in the first place over a year ago.  They were the ones who drew up my paperwork and presumably wrote the post-it note on the day I took delivery.  They looked into my file, saw the discrepancy and explained that something had changed in the system or policies and that the prior person wasn't wrong... According to Tesla I was no longer supposed to be receiving a $1000 rebate.  He was sorry for my inconvenience and promised to do his best to escalate and get answers.  He of course couldn't promise anything, but he would try.  A month later, I called and left a voicemail asking for an update... nothing.  

So what now?  Is there some other number I can call to override the ""whoever answers the phone"" situation I'm in now?  I have a direct number to the local guy, but he's not returning my calls, so it seems clear he either didn't try or didn't get the answer he wanted when he escalated and doesn't want to have to deliver that news.  I'm not on Twitter, so I can't hit up Elon directly (nor do I think that is probably appropriate at this stage... I gotta believe there is some middle management level that is better suited to fixing this) so I'm not sure where to go from here.

I know I'm not the only one who bought a car during this time frame.  13-14 months ago I was definitely talking about this very promotion with other users on this forum.  Anyone else have this issue?  Did anyone actually get their refund?

To be clear, this is not a situation where Tesla changed the price of a car I bought 3 days later and I'm pissed and want a rebate.  I changed my order from a less expensive model to a more expensive model based on information they confirmed over the phone prior to, during and after I changed my order.  I don't know what changed recently, but I can't imagine this is the sort of thing Elon would want his company to do on purpose.",teslamotors,1578887484,R0cketsauce,53,1,True,2020-01-12

8,Tesla could eventually boil all their vehicles down to single configurations,"What I mean by that is that like how the Cybertruck’s lack of paint would reduce manufacturing and logistical cost, and the use of rolled steel would reduce cost of manufacturing, Tesla could eventually use these principles in their other vehicles to achieve the ultimate production streamlining by offering one configuration for all their vehicles (and maybe drop the S/X for even further reduction in complexity)

This would be many years down the road but it could be a 350+ mile range car, dual motor, no paint job, one interior choice. Tesla could potentially make this vehicle for less than $22,000 possibly.

In this scenario each car wouldn’t be custom made for each customer but rather they’d just hand off the car that rolls off the production line to the next customer. It would insanely simplify logistics and manufacturing and Tesla could price those vehicles at a point where no automaker EV could ever compete on price. 
On top of that when Tesla launches their autonomous Service they would have to worry about maintaining the paint and dents on the autonomous cars.

Now I know this probably would never happen since all cars on the road would start looking the same and consumers, even with the lower price point, would be repelled but it’s still a nice thought exercise to imagine how much cost they could reduce if they did that.

My son thought it would be fun to hit the ""Thumbs Down"" button on all the songs that were playing in ""Today's Hits"" and ""Owner Favorites"" the other day.

My repertoire on the station is now a grand total of 5 songs that keep looping. 

Did an online chat with support this morning, they said create a mobile service request.  Created a local service request via the app, and the mobile tech chuckled, then said call roadside.  Called roadside, and they promptly told me the only way to reset is to factory reset the car.  They no longer give out the password for Slacker (Model X owner).

Factory reset of the car, for a simple fix like resetting a Slacker playlist, seems to be the nuclear option.  All of my address history, my charging locations, my phones, my seat preferences, my auto-raise suspension locations etc etc will all be lost. 

There has to be another way!  Any ideas? 

PS:  I even went to the slacker website to see the ""Today's Hits"" channel, and decided I can search for the songs and un-ThumbsDown them.  Nope.  As you know, searching for a song will create a new station based on it, but it won't play the song itself!  (and, with the song thumbs down, I can't even skip to it and unThumbsDown it!) .

Ignoring the layers of irony when calling out Tesla for being disingenuous, the 'pointless' argument is downright laughable. Yes, basic physics easily dictates the Cybertruck wins... And that's a bad thing? You'd rather have a truck that works against physics with cost-effective designs re-labeled as 'features'? Yes, the Cybertruck is heavier, and it's electric so torque transfer is immediate, so it obviously won... Isn't that the point? Isn't that exactly what you want in a pickup? Doesn't this make the case for more electric utility vehicles in general? 

Not saying Tesla will fulfill every promise advertised, but it's crazy how the main engineering arguments against Cybertruck are basically 'It's not a fair comparison because it's intrinsically better'.",teslamotors,1575992788,Mytiesinmymaitai,335,1,True,2019-12-10

88,Tesla is focusing in on customer service..,"I am in the Air Force and stationed in Germany. I reached out to Tesla because I didn’t have LTE service and navigation doesn’t work due to having North America navigation data (US Spec Model 3). Over the past couple months I have been working with one of their customer service reps who made me an appointment and gave the service center the go ahead to take care of me. I dropped the car off to the service center and they programmed my ESIM to work in Europe. Come to find out, Europe works off a different band and they have an additional antenna. LTE works, but only on 4G. So they enabled my WiFi to be on all the time! Awesome! At least I can use a hotspot while I’m abroad to “Netflix and Charge” and be able to use functions such as remote access with the app. 

They also uploaded European maps. But they didn’t receive clearance so they held my car for a few days. I had an upcoming vacation so I couldn’t leave the car any longer. So they said I would have to wait on the Navigation. No problem! A week or so goes by and I was told by my customer service rep in the states that my account has been updated to reflect that I am “US Military in Europe” and I am now clear to receive Europe and North America navigation data. 

Well at about that time, I lost contact with my rep. Tesla upgraded their customer service system. I received an email from him, but can’t contact him back. I get an error now. 

So I reached out on chat today to see if they could either push the Europe navigation data, get me back in contact with my rep or the engineering team who was working on my request. Sadly the new rep was of no help and was talking to me in broken English. Felt like I was texting a 14 year old. I couldn’t understand what he was trying to say 75% of the time. And I’m pretty sure he just made me another appointment for the service center. Also from the time I started the chat, till I got to talk to a live person, an hour had passed by. After we left the chat, I found myself wishing there was a way to document this horrible chat experience. Apparently with their new customer service upgrade, they now ask for feedback by sending you a survey afterwards! I feel better now and hopefully none of you have to deal with this illiterate fellow. 

Also, not looking for Tesla handouts. I paid to have my ESIM programmed. Willing to pay for Navigation Data as well. Will be here for 4 years, would like to be able to use my navigation. You can get maps for all the other US spec cars abroad, why not a Tesla? Was no problem for my wife’s Escalade. 

TL;DR: Reached out to customer service via chat, talked to an illiterate 14 year old after waiting for an hour. Didn’t resolve issue or try to help me get back in touch with my previous customer service rep. Received customer service survey, expressed my concerns! 😂

98,Best way to mount HWC to exterior wall,"Hi all,

I am having a NEMA 14-50 installed in a few weeks in conjunction with solar panels. Original reddit post [can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/e6o4nd/help_with_way_to_charge_tesla_outside_garage_and/) I have specified for my electrician to use 6-gauge wire in the event I want to directly wire the HWC into the existing NEMA 14-50 wiring and remove the 14-50.  Per code, a 50A breaker will be used and it will run at 40A charging. I'm pretty sure the onboard charger will detect this, but the Mobile Connector only charges up to 32A anyway, so I should be fine for the moment.  I'm also specifying that I want an industrial or commercial grade outlet, and I am going to buy a NEMA 14-50 pigtail intended for some newer appliances that also has 6-gauge wiring.  

&amp;#x200B;

[See this link for a great step-by-step](https://www.instructables.com/id/Tesla-Wall-Connector-Installation/) installation of the pigtail onto the HWC.

&amp;#x200B;

According to the chart on the Tesla website [here,](https://www.tesla.com/support/home-charging-installation/wall-connector) the difference between the 40A and 48A charging is only about 1.9 kW per hour, which translates loosely (at rated efficiency) to about 7 miles per hour of charge.  My commute is only 10 miles each way, so this is largely inconsequential to me.  My main reason for wanting the HWC would be to have a cleaner look on the side of the house, and I don't want to go buy a second mobile connector, I think.

&amp;#x200B;

[Here's a link to the exterior wall](https://i.imgur.com/GdzDR30.jpg) that I plan to install both the NEMA 14-50 and eventually the HWC to.  It's stucco-like, so I am thinking that I should put some type of mounting plate behind it, but I don't know exactly what.  I also think it would probably be a good idea to put some type of awning above it and possibly along the sides of it to help protect it from the elements even though it is outdoor rated, I figure it will add to the useful life of the product.

&amp;#x200B;

Someone suggested [something like this to cover the HWC from basic ""weather""](https://i.redd.it/3cqd0lo2tkwy.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

I'd also like to think about a solution to lock in the HWC for when I install it, meaning once I put the NEMA 14-50 cord into the outlet, it can be locked with a weatherproof type of box to be tamper resistant.  I live in a ""safe"" area, but I don't want to take any chances with someone disconnecting any components of the mobile connector while it's charging.  My understanding is that the adapter portion can be separated from the ""body"" of the mobile connector, but the Tesla-proprietary charger will lock into place unless it's below 40 degrees.  So, that means to me that if it's below 40 degrees, someone could theoretically remove the adapter 14-50 from the Mobile Connector, remove the charging portion from my car, and then walk away with it.  While this is an unlikely scenario - especially with Sentry Mode - it's still possible, hence why I'm preferring a HWC over a second MC type of setup.

&amp;#x200B;

I will be using the MC temporarily so I am considering the official [Tesla Cable Organizer](https://shop.tesla.com/product/cable-organizer) to help keep everything neat as well as [something like this](https://i.etsystatic.com/9784674/r/il/65dd3b/1566421625/il_794xN.1566421625_ev5p.jpg) to help ""hold"" the MC so it doesn't put tension on the NEMA adapter.  But again, slightly concerned about theft, and I would also not want to leave it out overnight.

&amp;#x200B;

I leave for work around or slightly before 6AM, so I am interested in a fast solution that gets me going.  It seems like the MC would have more ""steps"" to unplug it and unlock it from the tamper-resistant box from the NEMA outlet itself and then put the MC into the car.

&amp;#x200B;

102,Requested: Gift help for generous Tesla owner,"Hey everyone. I've wanted to know what it's like to own one of these cars - I drove one around the block and it was great but I want the full experience. I recently rented a Model 3 from Turo for an upcoming weekend trip. Very excite!

I told my close friend about the rental (we chat about Tesla and other tech stuff), and he said he was away until January and his Model 3 would be in his garage until then and that I am welcome to take his instead of the rental. This is an unusual offering for him, as he rarely lets anyone else drive it. I am incredibly appreciative of his gesture, and I would like to get him something nice for his car in return.

So Tesla owners (maybe Model 3 specifically), what is something cool for your car that you would be really happy to receive as a gift? I'm looking for unconventional things, as my friend is notoriously difficult to shop for at Christmas. It doesn't have to be **too** off the wall, just looking for something cool or helpful a Model 3 owner might not already own.

117,Car Needs Service. Car May Not Restart.,"The mobile app gave me an appointment that's a week out - but there is no way I'm driving around in a midwest winter for a week wondering if the car is going to start when I get back inside. 

So I called Tesla Service at the normal store that I visit but didn't talk to anyone because apparently they no longer pick up the phone.  I emailed the old Customer Service email address and received an automatic reply directing me to the website.  The website gives me a lot of options to buy things but none to actually help me get an appointment or talk to someone about a service issue.

So here I am with a car in the garage that I'm scared to drive because it might not restart and a company that seemingly couldn't give two shits if I can't use if for the better part of a week.

How you use it is totally up to you. But it's currently based on a piece of 8.5x11in paper, so if you print it at 100% scale, depending on your printer it should work. Otherwise you may have to scale it to get it to the right size. I have included a rudimentary scale so you can take a ruler and determine if it is.

What I would do after that is cut it out, glue it to the back of a small piece of film, and then cut it out. You don't have to be exact, as even the included Tesla ones aren't 100% coverage (they're slightly smaller than the footprint.

The other day it finally came on but only after I was halfway into a parallel parking spot.  I pressed start and let it finish hoping maybe it would trigger it to start working again.  This occurred under 36.2.1.  Earlier this week I received 36.2.4 and tried it at the shopping center, I passed multiple spots and it never came on.  I even backed up and went passed one twice to see if it would trigger, no luck.  40.2.1 came down yesterday afternoon and I haven’t had a chance to try it out.

160,Any link on in depth info on Tesla AI? Especially interested in traffic prediction implementations.,"We have all seen that Tesla's can often see accidents happening earlier than humans.  While that may feel like it is predicting the future to us, it isn't really.

A lot of defensive driving is about understanding what other drivers are likely to do, and predicting their likely behaviour. Whether or not they use their turn signal, you know a car slowing down before an off ramp will probably make a right lane change later on. Best not to get in their blind spot in case they didn't see us yet.

As keeping track of time in an artificial network is an interesting subject, I was hoping to find out more about Tesla's implementation, and if it is used at all. So far I haven't found any good resources apart from the long presentation.",teslamotors,1576067759,Imaharak,0,1,True,2019-12-11

212,40.2.1 quick observations,"2018 Model 3, LR, AWD, FSD,  2019.40.2.1

Manual Autolane change is quick when blinker manually activated it is moving into next lane as soon as you activate the blinker.  Didn’t have another vehicle next to me so not sure if it would delay and wait for adjacent vehicle to pass or if it would speed up and try to get in. My trip was too short to gather more data.

NoA Autolane change – still 6 blinks before it moves over.  First time a vehicle was approaching faster than I was traveling, lane marker turned red and it waited for the vehicle to pass and then changed lane, blinker remained on throughout.   There was a trailing vehicle but it was not traveling as fast as the adjacent vehicle and it changed lanes in front of it with plenty of room, nothing to report on.  Next time it autolane changed there was no adjacent vehicle and on 6th blink it began moving over.  So can’t say anything changed here with Nav on Autopilot from previous versions during this quick outing.

Stop Sign Notification.   Manually Stop sign notification does not do anything.  I engaged autopilot and dialed autopilot down to 5mph and allowed it to keep entering intersection (no cars were around) as nose of model 3 passed the stop sign the red steering wheel and hands warning appeared as the alarm went off.  Doesn’t appear to be taking into account your closing speed on stop sign.  Not sure what the value would be seeing if you were really in a situation and traveling at =&gt;25mph by time alarm goes off it would be too late, you’d be in the intersection before you could react.   

There’s another intersection in town that’s usually empty where you can see quite a ways in all directions.  I may try it at 10mph and see what happens, maybe it will trigger sooner.

AutoPark - Didn’t get to try autopark, all shopping centers were pretty empty and I was in a hurry.  Next time out I’ll cruise around the lot and see if I can find some to test it on.

- Cost wasn’t that bad. Most alignments in this area are $110-$130. Tesla was $140. 

Deltas:
- It took ALL DAY to get an alignment done. I dropped off at 8, they literally finished at 6pm

247,Unable to get my Model 3 yesterday,"I’ll try my best not to rant, but to say the least I’m very disappointed with my experience up to this point. 

I purchased a Model 3 last month. It was easy to order and my sales rep was great. I am leasing through Tesla and had been waiting to get my contract paperwork as my account told me they were getting it in order. 
Last week I get a text asking me to schedule my pickup date. I was so excited! My wife is on the lease too and has to also be at the service center for pickup. We work very different schedules so it was a big to do to get a time that worked for both of us. 
I still haven’t received my paperwork. I called Tesla and left a few messages at my local center asking when it would come so I could pay via ACH. Nothing. 
The day of my pickup came so I called again and was still unable to get someone on the phone. So I finally hit the extension for the service department just to see if I could get a human. I did and they put me on the phone with a sales person. 
I told him I was in the dark about payments. He said the contract was still being written up and to just being a personal check. 

Ok. So I did. My fiancé and I drove an hour and twenty minutes to the service center to get the car. I had work about an hour and a half after our scheduled pickup tome but I was told the pickup would be between 15 and 30 min. 

When we showed up the guy at reception told me the paperwork was being drawn up and to wait. 
So we did. For 45 minutes. During this time we were spoken to once. The staff seemed more concerned with getting the Thermostat in the show room just right than us. The woman who seemed to be handling our pickup told us the paperwork was only half done which was “odd for them” ,
But that it would be done soon. I let them know I had to leave for work soon and they said they would ask for a rush on the paperwork. 

They came back and told us that it would take up to two hours. But that they would be willing to deliver the car to us. This seemed like a reasonable compromise. They told us they would be in contact the next day (today). 

Today came and went. I called at the end of business. The guy I spoke to didn’t know anything about what I was talking about. Said it would be hard for them to schedule a delivery. That they would “be in touch with me.”

I’m so disappointed. I have been looking forward to getting a Tesla for years. The experience had left me feeling completely in the dark. As if I’m not valued to them because I’m JUST getting a model 3 and that I’m JUST LEASING. 

TLDR: Trying to lease a Tesla. Didn’t get to pick up my car on the scheduled day. No one has been in contact with me even thorough they said they were going to make it a priority.",teslamotors,1576113490,Shooting_Paper,35,1,True,2019-12-11

- Directional beeping for proximity warnings for sensors (emanate from speakers to let drivers know which sensor is giving a warning)
- Double tap car to have car visualization go back to default, currently you just have to wait for display to default back to driving view.
- Contest speed limits (I feel like 75% of the governing speed limits are -10 miles from the actual posted speed during my regular commute in Dallas)
- Auto-pilot will try to engage for x (preferably 2 or more) seconds instead of just failing immediately. (Oftentimes I will hit a small stretch where engaging auto-pilot will fail for .5 seconds and then it becomes available and I have to pay more attention to instigating auto-pilot properly than to the road)
- Show cabin temperature on the air conditioning screen (the app shows it so it is clearly a known entity).
- If you didn't have air conditioning on before turning on your defroster it should not leave air conditioning on after turning off your defroster
- Tap the headlight icon to flash your brights at other drivers (I use this frequently to let other drivers know their light aren't on or there is some other problem they should address)'

(2017).  first off, hold times on tesla phone line has gone up substantially; this was a 25 minute hold time. i told them my issue. they asked me to make an appointment via the app. which i tried, but was getting a date of may 16 2020? she then made the appt for me. someone called me the next day to help diagnose the issue. no luck. i get a text from a tesla representative asking some more questions and saying the cost for labor is 190/hr and rental is only available as per availability? i am guessing this is going to be a long appointment.  i ask for service center contact info as i need to arrange a loaner and need to know this is covered under warranty, the person i am texting stops responding. i need to ask the service center the following questions. 


1 is this under warranty. 
 2. will i get a loaner car?
3. timeline?

Why do i feel i cannot get straight forward answers from tesla service? how did their service go from literally a 99/100 to shit/100.  A key aspect of car ownership is ease of service.  If tesla can't keep that promise to me from when i purchased the car (2nd car by the way), what's the point? this is the 2nd car i purchased from tesla which i was told can drive itself. first one was 2015, and then they said oops no more hardware so i bought the 2nd one with FSD and now i need to wait for an upgrade on hardware.  feel i have been lied to multiple times by tesla now. I hear they stopped the ranger service where they pick up the car for you as well? 


Has anyone else experienced a degrade in level of service? 

any solutions?

any advice?",teslamotors,1576153976,blackamex,298,1,True,2019-12-12

Volume will erroneously auto-adjust itself to 80%, if I try to set it to 81-90%, while connected to my model 3. Tesla’s “Allow Mobile Control” option has no effect, but should. Repro’d on multiple iOS 13 devices. None of the iPhone Music Settings like Volume Limit or Sound Check have any effect. Killing the music app temporarily fixes it, but relaunching it resumes the buggy behavior. An iOS 12 device worked fine, as did a Mac and PC.

So, two things should happen:
* Tesla should fix their “Allow Mobile Control” option’s false behavior
* Apple should fix the iOS 13 music app to not act like it’s applying an 80% volume limit, when “Volume Limit” is off in Settings.",teslamotors,1576166077,dscrptr,37,1,True,2019-12-12

When I brought the issue up two weeks ago to schedule the appointment, the service member confirmed it was an issue and ordered the part for me. Today when I came in, the service leader told me that this shouldn't have been an issue and that it's common to have the cameras fog up and visibility covered. I had to argue back and have the service continue otherwise he would have dismissed it. My right B-pillar camera also fogged up a few times this week and I have another service appointment scheduled to replace that too. I've owned the car for over a year and have never seen fog in front of any of the cameras and it concerns me that both my B-pillars have fogged up in the same time frame after two weeks of heavy rain in SoCal.

Long story short, yesterday (Dec 11) a sales person at the Tesla show room told me that there was an almost exact match (except for the gray rims) showroom vehicle at a dealership about 150 miles away that I could have right away for $3000 off MSRP with only 993 miles on it. I figured, that was a good deal, so I told her to order it. When I got the email confirming, it turns out it was not $3000 off, it was only $1000 off. I told them that if I was only saving $1000 off the car I would much rather just keep my original order. They told me that if I un-matched from this car I would risk not getting the car in December and therefore miss the tax credits. Honestly, it sounded like they were just making things up as they went along, so I didn't leave there feeling particularly good about the info I was getting.

I'd like to hear from someone who has had a similar experience.  I'm wondering if I could get them to honor the $3000 off (I have the price they quoted me in a text message).

So I thought I'd post this flowchart so that people can understand that there is a direct link between the Battery Capacity and the Range displayed on the UI and that it is a very simple calculation that does not account for your driving. The only thing that will throw the range off is if your battery pack is very cold.

378,Terrible support experience,"Been trying to get solar and batteries installed since end of January and after they semi-installed them it’s now been zero communication.  

I’ve tried calling, emailing, escalating and just get empty platitudes about how busy they are and someone will get back to me.  I’ve got a 50 ft open trench they dug (twice) that’s been signed off by the city going on over 6 weeks now.  Really makes the home look great going into Christmas.  

I love the technology and I’ve loved my Tesla cars  but their energy company’s support is the worst I’ve ever experienced.  And I’ve worked with Att, Comcast, frontier, and directv... although Frontier is a close 2nd.

391,"Tesla Cybertruck Is Medium-Duty: Competition Is Ford F-250, Ram 2500","[https://insideevs.com/news/387790/tesla-cybertruck-compete-ford-250-ram-2500/amp/](https://insideevs.com/news/387790/tesla-cybertruck-compete-ford-250-ram-2500/amp/)

&amp;#x200B;

A CARB filing reveals that the Cybertruck slots into an  8,501-10,000-pound class occupied by the F-250, Ram 2500 and Silverado  2500.    

A new filing shows that the [Tesla Cybertruck](https://insideevs.com/tesla/cybertruck/)  won't directly compete against the Ford F-150, but rather against the  likes of the Ford F-250, Ram 2500, Chevy Silverado 2500 and other heavy  hitters in the medium-duty truck segment.

With this new competitive set (no longer including the F-150 and Ram 1500), [*Cybertruck OwnersClub*](https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/tesla-cybertruck-will-weigh-over-8-500-lbs-and-be-classified-as-medium-duty-pickup.259/) outlines the trucks against which the Cybertruck will compete. Here are those specs:

**Cybertruck**  
Max payload: 3,500 lbs  
Max tow rating: 14,000+ lbs  


**2020 F-250 (gasoline)**  
Max payload: 4,260 lbs  
Max tow rating: 19,500 lbs  


**2020 F-250 (diesel)**  
Max payload: 3,940 lbs  
Max tow rating: 22,800 lbs  


**2020 Ram 2500 (gasoline)**  
Max payload: 4,050 lbs  
Max tow rating: 19,780 lbs  


**2020 Silverado 2500HD (gasoline)**  
Max payload: 3,979 lbs  
Max tow rating: 14,500 lbs  


**2020 Silverado 2500HD (diesel)**  
Max payload: 3,715 lbs  
Max tow rating: 18,500 lbs

As *Cybertruck OwnersClub* tells *InsideEVs*:

&gt;*In a recent letter sent by Tesla to the CARB, the company says  the Cybertruck will be classified as a medium-duty vehicle, putting it  in the same class as the F-250, Ram 2500 and Silverado 2500, and not the  same class as the F-150 to which the Cybertruck has been most compared.*

My guess is that if people wanted a trailer it would make more sense (and likely be much more economical) to get a trailer that isn't cybertruck styled.

What if the trailer had additional batteries that would offset (or theoretically even extend) the loss of range you'd see from pulling a trailer.

When I got home at 4:30 I manually told it to update since it says it only needed 25 minutes and I didn’t need to go anywhere until 8pm. 

Since manually updating it at 4:30, the touchscreen displays a progress bar that’s stuck at 10%, the text “Updating to 2019.35.103” and under that, “Starting Update.” I’ve called in to vehicle support, here’s what we’ve tried: 

1) Wait through the manual update time - obviously, this didn’t fix it. 

2) Manually force the update from Tesla

3) Perform a reset (hold both scroll wheels and the brake until the Tesla logo pops back up on the screen) - this always bounces directly back to the screen I mentioned above. 

Is there something else we can try? Nothing’s working on Tesla’s side and about all they can do is tow it back to a service center 200 miles from my home.

Does anyone know what Teslas policy will be for covering HW3 retrofits?

After reading the Tesla warranty information, I see a gew different ways it could be interpreted.

1)  HW3 falls under standard 4yr/50k vehicle warranty.

2) HW3 gets a separate 4yr/50k warranty based on install date and mileage.

3) HW3 has seperate coverage (e.g. 1yr/15k miles) that is used if vehicle is out of warranty due to age or mileage at time of failure.  I think this senario is most likely, but it's just a guess.

Relevant section of warranty:

Basic Vehicle Limited Warranty
Subject to separate coverage for certain parts and the exclusions and limitations described in this New Vehicle Limited Warranty, the Basic Vehicle Limited Warranty covers the repair or replacement necessary to correct defects in the materials or workmanship of any parts manufactured or supplied by Tesla that occur under normal use for a period of 4 years or 50,000 miles (80,000 km), whichever comes frst.",teslamotors,1576268277,PrivacyToTheTop777,29,1,True,2019-12-13

442,Auto Headlights need Drivers' Ed 101.,"Auto headlight function has some problems that are basic safety things you learn in Drivers' Ed.

1. They go to high beam in fog. This makes it harder to see the road ahead due to reflections from the fog. That is why fog lights are mounted low and pointed low.
2. They don't come on after dawn or before dusk. In those 30-45 minutes when the sun is low, it is basic safety to turn on your headlights to make your car more visible to other drivers who may have the sun in their eyes. 
3. There is no way other than multiple touch-screen taps to turn them on when you are in a ""daylight safety zone"". This is typically a two-lane road with high traffic and winding roads. There you are asked, or even required, to turn on your headlights for safety.

451,Bad Dealer Experiences,"Let me preface this by saying I love my Model 3. I never want to own any other car until I become a millionaire and get the Roadster. 

However, my love for the car does not overshadow the shoddy experience I've gotten at the local dealership and service center. 

Starting with delivery, it took them three tries and a whole month after I was initially supposed to get my delivery to actually get a car in new condition. The first car I was supposed to pick up had pieces of the chrome window trims missing, scratches on the front bumper, and a CRACK in the back windshield. The second had scratches everywhere and alignment issues with the doors and panels. Then they finally got the third one delivered (which still had alignment issues, which have since been fixed).

Three months later, I got a leak in one of my tires, which turned out to be a nail. I called to see if they can check it out, and they told me to schedule an appointment through the app. The closest available date was two weeks later, so I had to spend nearly every day refilling my tire do I didn't give it uneven wear. 

When I go in for my appointment, the rep tells me it would cost $62 just to patch it. No replacement tire, just a patch. I asked why it was so expensive (since nearly everyone else does it for $10-$20, and he said they would have to take the tire off, and they would have to charge for the labor. I told him I'll take it somewhere else then, but they already took the nail out. So I'm stuck there.

Again, amazing car. But I am really disappointed with the delivery process and quality control. And I'm flat out pissed that I was screwed into overpaying for a simple patch job.",teslamotors,1576280266,tjamies2,11,1,True,2019-12-13

462,Significant Battery Drain/Range loss for Model 3,"I've purchased my LR RWD Model 3 for more than 1 year now. The vehicle performs beautifully and the overall battery range still holds pretty well, not much decay. However, in recent months, I noticed significant range loss/battery drain while parking, close to 10 mile per day (&gt;3%). Initially I thought maybe because I parked my car under sunlight in summer, so I turned off cabin heat protection. Only slight decrease were noticed (\~8 mile per day). And now in the mild winter weather of California, the vehicle still loses about 7-8 miles per day. I concerned about the health of battery and contacted Tesla. They ran remotely battery health diagnosis and told me the battery is fine. This phenomenon may exist longer than I realized, since I only noticed this when I started to use my Supercharger credit miles in recent months, which makes it much easier to monitor battery drain/range loss. 

Last week I was on vacation and did not drive the car for a whole week, and I found that there is only 1 mile per day range loss (\~0.3%) over the 7 days, which makes me thinking that the range loss is associated with driving. I routinely used EAP for my commute, which is a short one \~10 miles (single trip). Due to traffic and personal habit, I intervened some time, which could be happening more than average (per mile) among all users since it's a short trip. I'm wondering if the range loss is due to Tesla sending the EAP data to their data center via internet, as we know that they are probably using driving data, especially human intervention of EAP/AP to improve the algorithm.

I'm not claiming anything since I don't have any evidence for this, but I'm wondering if anyone has noticed the same thing or has tools that can monitor the data transfer to Tesla or a better explanation for the range loss.",teslamotors,1576287757,sunbingfa,5,1,True,2019-12-13

486,Can Tesla Netherlands sell to non-Dutch residents?,"Hello everyone, I am getting confusing information from Tesla Netherlands customer service whether I can really order and pickup the car if I am not a Dutch resident. The representative I spoke with told me that:

1. I need to have a registered address in Netherlands, and
2. A Dutch driving license

Otherwise, they will not be able to sell me the car. They said that they always have to register the car in the Netherlands. I explained that I would like to either take the car from Tilburg to Prague, Czech Republic (my home country) or have it picked up by a licensed car transporter. And also because of this, that I would like to be issued invoice without VAT since I need to pay it in Czech where the car will be registered.  
Can anyone who has successfully exported their car from Netherlands and in to their home country give me some tips and advices? If you could also tell me which department in Tesla you worked it with. And if possible, if you can send me privately the name of your delivery specialist who assisted you, that will really be great.",teslamotors,1576322011,theboywhoyawns,0,1,True,2019-12-14
487,Tesla's cybertruck may be blocked from coming to Europe for not meeting safety standards.,"According to the German safety and regulations institute TÜV the Tesla cybertruck does not meet the European safety standards. The body is too rigid which leads to too much force on the driver instead of the car in case of a crash. There need to be big changes in the chassis and structure of the cybertuck before it can be sold in West Europe.

Personally i would like to see the truck in Europe and i hope they can somehow meet the safety standards!

494,Feature Complete FSD Preview: Autopilot can drive 1 hour on city streets without disengagement,"Tesla drivers can now lower Autopilot’s set speed to 0 with software 2019.40+, and this avoids red lights and stop signs requiring a “braking disengagement,” which would turn off Autopilot. Similarly with the faster auto lane change, drivers can use the turn signal to position the car in the appropriate lane on city streets that have less space to complete the maneuver avoiding a “steering disengagement,” which would turn off Autosteer.

With these 2 new improvements, Autopilot can now — without human disengagement — drive a reasonable city route (with no highways) across Reno from residential streets to the airport and back. This particular route takes 1 hour traveling near 20 miles, crossing through 170 street intersections, turning into 110 curves, and stopping for 26 traffic lights and 4 stop signs. There’s a lot a variety here: ranging from no lane lines to 6 lanes in the same direction, parked cars on the side, divided medians, elevation change, one-way traffic, school zones and construction areas.

[View map of 0 disengagement route](https://preview.redd.it/jkoe7xx85m441.png?width=1316&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e48fd6a6bec38d38db7c0288b9272a252c8bb11)

To be clear, this is a carefully chosen route, and using current Autopilot on city streets can be extremely dangerous. Notably, navigating this route requires only going straight through every controlled intersection, and sometimes I needed to position the car in the appropriate lane to have the car take the straight path. There are a couple intersections that have guiding lines (for other directions) where Autopilot would plan a path leading into oncoming traffic, but moving to the adjacent lane before entering the intersection avoids Autopilot from being confused by these lines.

Elon Musk has mentioned “Feature Complete” Full Self-Driving a few times, and from my experiences using Autopilot around the city, the main missing feature really does seem to be the ability to stop the car, but just because a feature is “complete” doesn’t mean it’s safe or even usable for many corner cases yet. Here’s a list of FSD features and how they’re currently used on highways and could be improved for city driving:

* Keeping Distance: traffic-aware cruise control and stopping for obstacles, e.g., pedestrians
* Planning Paths: lane-centering and steering around obstacles, e.g., double-parked vehicles
* Predicting Movement: detecting cut-ins and cross-traffic behavior, e.g., taking unprotected turns
* Navigating Routes: taking an interchange and not just going straight, e.g., right-turns at intersection
* Stopping Conditionally: not requiring an obstacle to stop, e.g., red lights and school buses

Theoretically, I guess our HW2.5 car could get software for feature complete, but it just wouldn’t be as safe. Whereas practically, the FSD computer is able to process the side cameras at full resolution and full frame rate to better determine when it’s safe to take an unprotected left turn as well as handle larger neural networks to improve the accuracy while reducing the latency of each of the features listed above.

So for those who want to get a sneak preview of various aspects of FSD without disengagements, adjust the set speed to 0 and find a route that doesn’t require turns at intersections, and be ready to Take Over Immediately.

[View take over immediately warning](https://preview.redd.it/ifz1jbj65m441.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d40490fa4236f057c67aa1f095ed7fd6a6164b69)

Hopefully soon, Navigate on Autopilot will be enabled for city driving along with the new stopping feature, and then the number of routes without disengagement will significantly increase, but people should especially still make sure Autopilot doesn’t do something crazy like driving the wrong way.

&gt;P.S. For those just wanting to safely test out the Stop Sign Warning, you can turn on Autosteer with a 0 set speed then press the accelerator to coast to the stop line, and if Autopilot predicts it won’t stop in time without additional braking, it’ll show the warning. Seems like you’re more likely to get the warning at stop signs that are mapped in OpenStreetMap, but that’s not a requirement as Tesla doesn’t directly use OSM for navigation maps, and I’ve even triggered the warning at a temporary stop sign in a construction zone.

&gt;I would suggest testing at stop signs where you can continue straight and are mapped on OSM: [https://overpass-turbo.eu/?Q=`node[highway=stop]({{bbox}});out;`](https://overpass-turbo.eu/?Q=node[highway%3Dstop]({{bbox}})%3Bout%3B) Position the map to the desired area then click the `Run` button, and go to a (low traffic) street with a high concentration of blue circles.

0,I went to a Tesla store today.,"I've been a big fan of Tesla and Elon for many years since reading his biography. I've know that the Model S and the Model X were always going to be out of my price range, so when the Model 3 was announced and it would be priced so that it would be affordable to the masses to say I was excited would be an understatement. 

For the last few months I've been more infatuated with the cars than usual by scrolling through pictures, stalking the custom build website, and driving my wife up a wall with my justification attempts. But today she humored me and agreed to go to the store with me to look at the Model 3.

I was like a kid in Disney when I walked in the store. The sales representative was polite, knowledgeable, and attentive. Going over all the savings from being an all electric car to all of the normal maintenance that would no longer be needed. But when it came down to the bottom line, I realized that I wouldn't be able to pull the trigger. Not for a while anyways. Maybe in a few more years the dream will come true, until then im just another Tesla fan who loves this sub and company.

TL;DR - Big fan and wanted to share. Went to a store and finally came to acccept they're still out of my price range for now. Still love the company and this sub!",teslamotors,1573345942,VikingFuneral09,110,1,True,2019-11-09

We were driving on the interstate around 9pm EST, so it was dark. We were driving manually with navigation on. So no autopilot. We were in the right lane. We came up on an entrance lane where our right side white line disappeared. For whatever reason, the Tesla picked up the entrance lane far white line AND assumed we were drifting over it when we were in the center of our lane. It harshly swerved us to the left and came very close to colliding with a car in the lane to our left. If it helps, it was on a very slight left curve on the interstate

14,PSA: Your trade-in quote will not be honored if you pick up 1 minute after 30 days is up. Customer service is not your friend.,"Let me precede by saying I love Tesla cars and am a huge Elon fan. I bought my first Model S in 2017 and bought and still own Tesla stock from 2012. 

But, their customer service has gone to complete shit the past couple of years. Not just for my issues today but, in general, things are handled sloppily quite often. I understand they are busy and many are overworked but the level of service, the quality of service and the way they treat loyal, long term customers is not very good. 

Today I went to pick up a new Model S that I ordered on October 11. Our pickup time was 10am. We arrived a couple of minutes early eagerly awaiting our new car. 

I was offered a pretty decent price for my current S and decided to trade it in. We met with our Delivery Specialist a few minutes after we arrived and began the paperwork process. 

Soon after, I noticed that my trade in wasn’t listed in their paperwork. It’s listed on the website when I login but this guy didn’t know I had a trade in. Not the biggest deal in the world and mistakes happen but this is the sloppiness I mentioned. 

He needed to fix his paperwork.  And guess what, there was some “IT problem” so we sat there for about 90 minutes without much explanation or apologies. Just a “thank you for your patience”.  Again, mistakes happen, nothing is perfect but another F up. I wasn’t that upset really and was just ready to get everything settled so we could be on our way. 

After that long wait our Delivery Specialist came back with the new papers with the trade in included. But, there was a big error now with the trade in. I was being offered $1200 less than what Tesla quoted me on 10/7/19. 

It says right in the email that the trade in quote is good for 30 days and this was the 33rd day. The quote was good until November 6 and today was November 9. When I bought the car on October 11 it had a 2–3 week delivery estimate. 

The delivery people and the manager told me the 30 days was company policy. That’s understandable but there’s no mention of that in the email. Sure I could have googled it but that’s not something I’m really thinking about at the time of order. I figure they’d honor it based on when I order, not when I pick it up. The main thing is if Tesla had kept their word and delivered it in the 2–3 week window they initially promised I would have saved $1200. 

As mentioned, I’m a huge Tesla fanboy. Today I was picking up my 2nd 80k+ car in less than 3 years. And I walked out of there with a very sour taste in my mouth. 

Not only is their customer service pretty bad and unreliable lately but the way they treat a long term customer is not good. 

There isn’t much of an alternative if you want a great electric car so unfortunately I can’t just take my business elsewhere. Absolutely love my car but not the company right now.",teslamotors,1573358556,10JQKDS,64,1,True,2019-11-09

![video](z5nkz4q4dux31 ""I have been using Model 3 LR for the last 3 months. I generally had a very good experience with the car and its safety features. The incident today shook me a bit. I was driving on the leftmost lane when the lane was closed suddenly. The car in front of me was completely stopped. However, the AP continued to accelerate towards the car till I took over (I should have reacted earlier) and slammed the breaks. I barely managed to stop with a few inches to spare."")

I am curious if anyone had similar experiences. I have read in the past that teslas are very good with early warning. I am not sure if this is because it was the night. Usually, the car makes a loud sound when I am accelerating faster than the car in front of me and if it looks like a collision is about to occur.  


Lastly I would like to add to please be careful. This may be an edge case but these thing do happen. I feel like I was very lucky tonight.

38,Another ICE convert (half),"TLDR at the bottom.  


I currently own two ICE vehicles, 2016 Lexus NX200T which is my daily and a 1991 Toyota MR2 T-Top Turbo (400rwhp) which is my summer/weekend/track car.   
In mid-October I jokingly told my parents I was going to buy a new car and trade in the Lexus and they said they were actually looking to replace their 2004 Toyota RAV4 in the Spring with something new/used.   
End of October, I decided to give my parents the NX, I'll just trade in their RAV4 and get a new car.  
Always wanted a Tesla Model S/X but never considered the 3, after watching all these Tesla videos mainly revolving on the 3 and lurking on r/teslamotors.  
On November 2, I decided to go take a look at the Model 3 in person because looking at reviews on YouTube was not going to sell me on placing an order. Arrived at the Tesla store in Dedham and asked for a Model 3 test drive (*huge mistake*). Now I'm used to power from the MR2 but when I finally got to a straight away and the advisor said this is probably the best place to step on it: -steps on pedal- ""OH F$#@"".  
That instant torque blew me away and I was smiling and giggling like a little boy in his favorite candy shop.  
Arrive back at the store, checked inventory and lo and behold, there was a Model 3 Stealth Performance (ty this reddit for so many posts about it)  
I told the rep I wanted it but he said I would have to take delivery next week since it's in inventory. I needed to clear up some other debt so I just decided to place an order for the Model LR and expected to get it by maybe Christmas.    
On the drive home in the NX I was thinking to myself, ""I want that stealth"" and so I got back home and cleared up any loose ends.

November 6, since everything was being processed, I asked the rep to put me in for the Stealth with 18s but they did not have any. So I settled for a White w/ black interior and 19s.

November 7, assigned a VIN, ""Please select delivery date"".

November 8, everything was clear and so I spoke to the rep about applying for the financing. Applied and was hoping for a response the next day.

November 9, no response, did a quick follow up and the rep went to check in with Tesla Financial.

November 10 - APPROVED!

November 12 - Taking delivery!  


Now I probably won't get rid of the MR2 because it has too much money invested into the suspension, braking, motor, etc but I'm ecstatic to drive the M3 every day.

42,Option to disable Time of Use (TOU),"I live in the northeast and really looking forward to the scheduled departure feature in 36.2.1 to ensure that regen loss is minimized in the 30 F winter mornings. However I just realized after reading the manual (RTFM) that even though I don’t leave till 8:15 the car will charge up til only 6am because of TOU charging rates. I have flat rates all day and don’t want the battery cold soaked for a couple of hours after charging. 

Why does Tesla assume everyone has TOU rates? I think there should be an option to have TOU rates enabled/disabled and also maybe specify the time (maybe not everyone’s rates change at 6am).

56,TM3 - Issue I would like other owners input on. Do you constantly fight your TM3 not properly turning off/locking after exiting? Screen stays on? AC on? No auto-locking?,"I've been dealing with this issue ever since I got my TM3 a little over year ago. I've spent 7 months in communication with my local rep and she was kind enough to get a technician in the email chain. This is what he said to me after looking at logs -

\&gt;As far as the screen staying on, I was able to look at some information from your car. From what I saw on the different time stamps. You were exiting the car while your foot was still pressing the brake and sustaining yourself, or pushing off on the brake, and that keeps the vehicle active as a safety precaution in case the Driver seat sensor fails, or door latch sensor fails, so it doesn’t force into park as was accustomed, but it has a different set of readings. That’s why opening and closing the door turns off the screen. 

  
I have extensively tested this issue over the last year and I can say with 100% confidence that the issue persists regardless of whether I ""push off"" the brake pedal when exiting the car. There have been many times where even after hitting the park button on the right clicker and exiting without touching the brake the screen still stays on, car doesn't lock, etc.

  
This is a really problematic issue because I live in southern california and its common for me to have the A/C on. If I exit my car in a hurry or distracted, the car will stay on (Lights, A/C, screen/stereo, etc) and not lock. It assumes that me or a passenger is still in the car and as far as I can tell there are no security features enabled while its stuck in this state. The car does not lock. I do need to test whether or not the car can be driven without the key in this state, it just usually happens and is an annoyance and I would have to go hide my phone and walk back to the car and see.

Next one was ""Blindspot Detection Limited - Camera Visibility Reduced"" - this time cleaned up all sensors and cameras around the car but message still popups on the screen. Is it because cameras or sensors freeze?

73,Flying Deer in Minnesota,"It was Wednesday, November 6th.  I was driving home in our Tesla Model 3 on a small blacktopped township road.  It was almost high noon with a blue cloudless sky overhead. Out my driver’s side window a wide-eyed buck with a 2-foot rack was coming straight for me.  Then I heard the thud.  I looked in my rear view mirror and saw motion across the other side of my car. He had jumped entirely over our car. I stopped, got out and directly on the cross beam above me was a clump of dirt.  His hooves had hit the most resiliant spot. My first thought was to thank my lucky stars that rack had not gotten any closer. The second thought was of my husband and the joy he has known since we got our Tesla. He met me at our driveway and after being grateful for my return, he sputtered how, “If only. If only the dashcam system had been working. That video would have been awesome. A sure winner. Wow!” he kept repeating. “I bet that one could have gotten all the way to Elon.”

The pin is shown on the house further from the street, which is exactly correct. Navigation to our house brings you to the end of our driveway on the correct street, which is fine.  But navigation *from* our house tells you to drive over the footbridge across the creek and start out on the next street back. Only as you drive down to the correct street does it figure it out.

This was fixed in Waze by adding the driveway and marking the house numbers. OpenStreetMap seems to have been updated around the same time.

-I heard there was some issues with replacement battery prices, but Nissan started offering refurbished ones? 

-Are the newer ones substantially better than the older ones? 

-How much did you spend on battery replacements, and how often/after how many miles would you probably need one?

89,Model 3 impressions after a two week test drive,"I rented a model 3 AWD LR on turo for two weeks. I had a lot of surprises, despite reading nearly every post on this sub each day. 

**general**

I was really impressed by the comfort of the seats, the one pedal driving (which my wife hated), and how well put together the car felt. There was a lot of room in the car for luggage. We fit six suitcases in the trunk and frunk, plus a stroller and two car seats in the back. 

The car had no paint issues (red) and no fit/body issues that stuck out to me. 

They gave me a key fob. I asked if I could use the app, but they said no, which was understandable.

We tried installing three seats across the back and unfortunately it just doesn’t work. I’ve seen people make it fit with three booster seats, but two infant seats and one booster seat doesn’t seem practical.

I wish the roof came in a normal metal variant. The car was warm inside from the sun when it was 6 degrees outside. I’m moving to a city where it will be 115 F every day in the summer. I worry about the glass roof in that context, but the ability to turn on the AC before going to the car overall would probably make it better than a traditional car. 

**efficiency**

The biggest surprise for me was averaging 272 wh/m over the 800ish miles we drove. It was 6 degrees F for a lot of the time and we were in the mountains, so a lot of up and down terrain. 

**range anxiety**

Despite the good efficiency we got, I still had bad range anxiety. The car was losing 8-10 percent some nights. The owner said that’s normal. My assumption is the car is not sleeping due to something he has tracking the car/stats.

I really want to buy a model 3 but I need it to make a 240 mile one way trip with no chargers along the way but a destination charger at each end of the trip (and also be in an area where the warranty can’t be used). I don’t think I have the confidence at this time to pull the trigger on it due to those two factors plus the difficulty with 3 car seats in back.

I charged on a normal wall outlet. I was actually surprised at how much it adds up when you’re just sitting around watching football all weekend at home. But I’d still get the dryer outlet installed in my garage if I get one. I felt like I was constantly trying to keep the range above 50%, which was stressful. I do think this would go away  With time and with having a faster charging method easily available. I used a destination charger at various businesses on four occasions and it worked great. 

**autopilot/fsd **

The car had FSD. I fail to see how FSD is worth the price, even if it recognizes lights and stop signs tomorrow. I enjoyed driving the car. Autopilot is great on the freeway. Lane changing was awesome (still had to use the blinker on this one), but not used frequently enough to be worth much to me. I felt like I could trust it in general when cruising with light traffic, but it had some funny decisions when there was construction or where old lines and new lines intersected on the road. Overall, I was impressed but would definitely stick with the basic autopilot features over FSD. Also, I could never get the parking feature to work where it backs into a spot for you. I didn’t go out of my way, but I only noticed it pop up with an option at inappropriate times. 

Overall it’s my favorite car and lived up to the hype I had put on it. I’m surprised it didn’t push me to put down a deposit, but if the Y is wider in the back, it might be the one to get me over the edge. Otherwise, I’ll wait until the AWD LR is around 35k used and also buy a minivan for my wife.",teslamotors,1573434719,Quackattackaggie,46,1,True,2019-11-10

Now I'm at the hotel attempting to charge for the trip home; the charging screen on the Android app says ""Charging Complete / 288 mi"", and there is a bit of blank space between the right-hand edge of the green bar indicating charge and the white line indicating the charge target.

It is 36 degrees F here, if that makes a difference. I tried moving the charge target back and then forward again, and I rebooted the phone in case that made any difference.

157,"Eight months, 18.5k miles, one giant road trip, and two crashes in: I love this car, and here are my thoughts.","I ordered my AWD Model 3 in mid-February of this year and received it on March 2nd. Due to the price changes in that time I was able to get FSD for the original price that I expected to pay. My first few months I had a ton of fun driving it around - taking every excuse I could to drive it. My car was delivered with no issues, and I everything went smoothly other than receiving two marks on my rear bumper while street parked that Sentry mode didn’t catch. 


After graduating from college in June I set out in early July on a 3.5 month and 18,500 mile road trip. I started off in Maryland and drove straight to Maine in one day. After Maine I explored a lot of New England, then shot west to Seattle, then down to San Diego, up through Albuquerque to Denver, then to Austin, and back east through Nashville and Asheville. Along the way I visited 106 breweries and many national/state parks.


On the whole it was an incredibly effortless road trip. I let autopilot drive about 90% of the way, and only had one bad instance of phantom breaking while I was in Albuquerque which easily could’ve resulted in me getting rear ended. There were a lot of incredibly fun roads to drive which I can tell you about, and I spent two hours going back and forth on tail of the dragon. 


For the most part I had no issues with charging, and stopped at several dozen superchargers along the way. My main complaint as far as that is the number of superchargers near national/state parks. At Glacier National Park I had to spend a night outside it charging at a free level 2 charger while I slept, and couldn’t explore too much while still getting back to the closest supercharger that day. I also had similar trouble with Mt. Rainier, Crater Lake, and the Grand Canyon wherein I had to plan ahead if I wanted to stay the night, and was limited on how much I could explore with a day trip. I would’ve liked to see Carlsbad Caverns, but would have had to spend the night there at an RV park or other level 2 charger due to a lack of superchargers in the area.


My only complaint over the course of owning this car is that it has been a crash magnet. Other than the previous two unexplained marks it’s been crashed into twice in the last month while parked. The first time was while I was in Austin towards the end of my trip when my cousin’s wife [backed into it](https://i.imgur.com/sAmMeTq.mp4) while taking their kids to school. This caused [fairly minor damage](https://i.imgur.com/vA6onnJ.jpg) resulting in the replacement of the driver’s side front fender, the driver’s side headlight, and the front bumper. Luckily Tesla was able to do the repairs themselves, and if not for insurance being slow to mail a check it would have been completed within a day. Their insurance paid for everything, and I’m currently figuring out a diminished value claim. The second time occurred after I got back. Three nights ago, while my car was street parked in west Philadelphia I was notified at 3:50am that my alarm was going off, and ran outside to find [this damage](https://i.imgur.com/VDh4DY9.jpg) from a hit-and-run. I immediately called the police, and while [sentry mode captured it all](https://i.imgur.com/VYH6frd.mp4), it seems the plates didn’t match the car and the car was likely stolen. I had to file this with my uninsured motorist coverage, but I didn’t have to pay a deductible out of pocket and it looks like it will be fully covered. 


Other than the accidents I’ve absolutely loved the car, and can’t imagine owning any gas car again. Someday I want to get a test drive in a 911 or an F-type to see if gas cars are fully ruined for me, but unless I was spending $500,000+ I can’t see myself buying anything not electric. While my car was in the shop for the last accident I had a Hyundai Tucson loaner and did not like it at all. My Model 3 has been incredibly cheap to run, needed no maintenance other than tire rotations, service has been easy and is far and away my favorite car that I've ever driven.",teslamotors,1573505052,broccoliflowers27,41,1,True,2019-11-11

209,Story time: My M3 dashcam helped catch a thief on Sunday,"This past Sunday I went on a hike with my daughter in the Oregon Columbia River gorge. I parked along the side of the road leading up to the trail head along with several other cars. As I left, I turned on sentry mode just in case there was trouble. I'm glad I did.

Upon returning to the car about an hour later, two groups of people were standing next to their cars staring at what was left of their passenger side windows. They confirmed their cars were broken into and that an officer was on his way. I told them I probably had video. I checked my car which was parked two cars behind theirs and sure enough, sentry caught four events. Luckily, one of the victims had a laptop (she brought it with her on the trail) and I transferred the files from my USB drive to her computer. I had to get back home so did not stick around to review the footage.

When I got home I checked the video. Turns out it was the guy in a Range Rover parked right in front of me! His license plate was clearly visible. The video showed that only one minute after leaving my car, he got out of his car and cased out my Model 3, doing a complete walkaround, even looking right into the front facing camera. I had nothing in my car so he returned to his vehicle. Several minutes later, he can be seen getting out and disappearing in front of his car. A couple minutes later, he comes back into view and can be seen throwing a bag into his car and driving away.

Having what basically amounted to a smoking gun, I called the county sheriff's office and the dispatcher put me in touch with the deputy who was at the scene. He said he had reviewed the footage with the victim on her laptop and he confirmed he saw everything I did. He had a lot of questions about the Tesla and how the security camera worked. He took my info, thanked me and said he'd get in touch if they needed more info.

While I don't know if the thief has been caught, I felt really good that the car was able to help get a petty crook off the street, and that I was able to help both the victims and the deputy in some small way, as well as providing some good PR for this amazing car and it's security features.

At first I was hesitant to try this but decided to give it a shot and to my surprise it actually worked! I went back on the post and saw that many were having the same results. Now to be clear it didn’t work for all but I would say it was about 50%. Worth a shot for those of you still waiting.


2019.36.2.1 is currently downloading on my car. I previously had 2019.32.12.2 for those wondering.

Car: 2018 Model 3 RWD LR, no EAP or FSD.",teslamotors,1573536840,geniuzdesign,19,1,True,2019-11-12
215,Used X 2016 60D/75D or 2017 75D,"Hey, Reddit I need your help.

My fiance finally came to me and told me she is ready to pull the trigger on an X for her. Now she does not care what she gets other than 2 stipulations. She wants to make sure she gets one that either hs FSD or can purchase FSD later on and she just wants one either by the end of this year or the beginning of next year.

Now to my questions:

I am looking to get one of 2 or 3 models and need help on how to decide which one and to justify the price difference before I jump to either one.

As of posting this here are some of the ones I have found on the Tesla site.

2016 X 60D with 40k miles with 2.0 AP so we can get FSD $57.5k (I was able to confirm that this does have AP2 or is a late post-October model as all models that quote ""Autopilot Hardware"" are 2.0 and anything that quotes ""Autopilot with convenience features"" is 1.0)

* Solid White Paint
* 20"" Silver Wheels
* Tan Leather Seats
* Autopilot Hardware
* Smart Air Suspension
* Keyless Entry
* Power Liftgate
* Six Seat Interior
* Dark Ash Wood Décor
* Light Headliner

2017 X 75D with 34k Miles already with FSD for $69.8k

* Pearl White Multi-Coat Paint
* 20"" Silver Wheels
* Cream Premium Interior
* Full Self-Driving Capability
* Smart Air Suspension
* Ultra High Fidelity Sound
* HEPA Air Filtration System
* Subzero Weather Package
* Towing Package
* Keyless Entry
* Power Liftgate
* Five Seat Interior
* Figured Ash Wood Décor
* Light Headliner

Visually they are the same, fiance did say the did not care too much about the color but would either want blue on black or white on tan. But definitely did not want Tan with any interior as the Tan is ugly (which I agree) So both work as they are the exact same so there will be no discussion there other than 2017 having a multi-coat. I am not sure what cream vs tan is but the pictures look almost the same so I am saying they are. 

Although this is not my vehicle (I have a 3) I do like the idea of having pretty much all the bells and whistles in 2017 especially the sound system. I would prefer to have a 6 or 7 seater as my 3 can seat 5 and it defeats the purpose of having an SUV if we cannot seat more (which is a huge bummer actually but not sure if we are able to retrofit the 6 or 7 if we were to buy them from lets say a wrecked X)

Here are my pros and again I am just looking for some insight while I am also talking to my self while typing this. 

2016 X

Pros: 12k cheaper, can purchase FSD, 

Cons: 60D so fewer miles by 30-40ish, must purchase FSD which is $7k at the moment, 

&amp;#x200B;

2017 X

Pros: Has all the bells and whistles, FSD included, 75D longer range by 30-40ish miles

Cons: 12k more, 5 seater, 2.5 allows for dashcam (which in this day in age with all the keying going around is a huge pro)

So I realized I did not really ask my questions:

1. Are there any main differences between 2016 vs 2017 other than 2.0 vs 2.5 since both can get FSD?
2. Can I upgrade the seat configuration later either through tesla or by maybe getting the seats from a salvage?
3. Is the 30-40 mile really worth it? I got the long-range 3 but did that because I felt like I would have range anxiety if I did not but now that I think about it I could have gone with a standard range and been fine
4. Is there anything else that I am missing to compare, pros/cons, etc?

Again I appreciate any and all feedback and help. I do not have anyone else to really talk to about this as the people I know aka my mother and cousin bought an S and 3 because of me and know way less than I do about Teslas. But I also want a 3rd party other than family or Tesla salesperson to talk to, just to see if there is anything else that I am leaving out or not thinking about.

218,My Model 3 was broken into tonight and Sentry didn't work,"Someone pulled hard on the passenger door handle tonight and got in my locked Model 3. 

Starting at 2:30 - https://streamable.com/ipior
Rest of break-in - https://streamable.com/wwti2

Sentry didn't work, and as you can see, none of the lights in the car turned on. The car completely missed that it was broken into, which seems like a significant failure of even the most basic alarm functionality.

Fortunately all of value that was stolen was a gift card and some loose change, but my house and work keys were in the car too. Lesson learned, I suppose, but that doesn't change the fact that no alarm sounded, sentry didn't record the ordeal (the robber left the USB!), and my phone didn't notify me.

I thought for sure I was about to nail the criminal once I saw he left the USB behind, but all I was left with was my front-facing external cam audio... which isn't really helpful.

I'm a big Tesla fan, but I have to say I am HUGELY disappointed this evening. PSA: don't put all your trust in Sentry.

225,New Model codes for 2020 Model 3,"Buried in the configurators are model codes used by Tesla  such as MT301 which up to now has denoted a Model 3 Standard Range Plus RWD car, but they're changing and some 2020 cars are already showing the code as MT308. 

All Model 3 codes have changed but MS and MX have not. 

The rest of the VIN is still is showing as Freemont as the manufacturing location so I can't see these being cars built in China

I can't see any other changes to the actual car spec and the only way to see is delving into the options codes in the HTML, and its not left and right hand drive variants as the US configurator is using the new model codes.

Here's a UK car with the new model code as an example  (using tesla-info links as they don't die if the car is sold)

 [https://tesla-info.com/detail.php?ref=9875ef30cb5a45c190956e08f9988873](https://tesla-info.com/detail.php?ref=9875ef30cb5a45c190956e08f9988873) 

Its not universal however, here's a Canada 2020 car with the old code

 [https://tesla-info.com/detail.php?ref=8177bd9a57c7ed6861cacde0745b5a95](https://tesla-info.com/detail.php?ref=8177bd9a57c7ed6861cacde0745b5a95) 

Is there a planned update on the cards already? Kind of doubt it but its pointing to something changing early next year as Tesla don't normally change these codes and they're only changing them for the M3 and not the MS and MX. I've not seen this been mentioned before, I have seen reports of Tesla talking about 2020 model year cars but Tesla have previously never had model years - maybe this is confirmation they're about to start",teslamotors,1573551886,JonG67x,11,1,True,2019-11-12

Plus here's a summary from his old tweetstorm from Electrek.
 https://electrek.co/2018/06/27/tesla-pickup-truck-everything-we-know/

Here’s a comprehensive list of the information we gathered from his Tweetstorm on the subject:

It’s going to be a big truck.

Musk said that it will feature a step that will lower to step into the truck and he said that Andre the Giant will be able to fit in the driver’s seat.

The Tesla Truck is going to be a 6-seater.

It’s going to have an option for 400 to 500 miles of range “maybe higher”

Musk previously said that platforms like the Model S and Model X would probably be capped at 125 kWh of energy capacity, but he said that the truck platform will offer an opportunity for a much bigger battery pack.

Dual Motor All-wheel-drive powertrain with dynamic suspension will be standard on the truck.

The truck will have a 240-volt connection for heavy-duty tools and even an air compressor to run air tools.

the second part was a suggestion that Musk liked since the truck will already have a pneumatic system for the air suspension.

‘300,000 lbs of towing capacity’.

That’s another tweet where you have to ask yourself ‘is he kidding?’, but he is most often not. Though I’d bet the actual rated capacity is going to be much lower and like the Model X, owners will be able to push the truck further.

It will be able to float.

Musk referenced how the Model S is able to, but that’s up to a certain degree and it’s obviously not recommended.

The Tesla Truck will have lockers.

Musk said that ‘it will look like a truck’.

I take this as he is not planning an overly different design because it’s electric. He mentioned that he likes the design of the old Bronco.",teslamotors,1573576278,BBQLowNSlow,9,1,True,2019-11-12

I live in Central California and placed an order with Tesla because I own a Model 3 and their quote was the best price of the four I received.

It has been an exasperating and incredibly frustrating experience -- especially since I want to support the company and am such a big fan of Tesla Motors.

312,Autopilot Acceleration &amp; Deceleration Characteristics,"Hi All,

Prospective Model 3 or Model Y buyer.  Have been doing my research for a few weeks, curious about the autopilot characteristics for cruise control and for autopilot.  For example, I see that there's a Chill Mode that is either off or on.  What I'd like is even more customization - not sure if it's there yet - but obviously could be pushed in a future release.

&amp;#x200B;

In my Subaru, I have 4 Cruise Control Acceleration Options:  Eco, Comfort, Standard, and Dynamic.  Eco keeps my RPM's down below 2k and gradually comes up to speed, which is good for my fuel economy and general wear-and-tear on the vehicle.    I can also change ""following"" distance to 1, 2, 3, 4 ""bars"" which generally corresponds to ""2 seconds"" of following distance which is dynamic with speed, so 4 bars would be ""8 seconds"" of following distance, which is dependent on speed.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anything surpass the Chill mode?    Does Autopilot allow you to customize how close/far you can follow the target in front of you?

314,Model 3 SR+ with FSD or LR AWD without FSD for Toronto?,"Hello friends! I ordered the Model 3 SR+ with full self driving, but I’m having second thoughts about its range (\~360km @ 90%), especially with all the cold and snow we’ve been getting here in Toronto. Winter came a bit early this year! I test drove the SR+ and I am happy with the sound system, acceleration and just about everything else. I am planning to install snow tires and Homelink afterwards! 

My commute to work and back is about 110km per day. I’ll be charging at home every night, but I do want to have the flexibility of going to other places in the Greater Toronto Area after work, even during winters where there's range loss. I don’t have a charger at work.

Now to my questions! Do you think the SR+ will be good enough for my driving? Any SR+ owners in cold climates that wish they opted for the LR instead?

I’m working roughly around the same budget, so upgrading to the LR AWD would mean that I’d be giving up on full self driving, which costs $9200 CAD :( . I also miss out on $5000 federal incentive, so the price difference for the upgrade is about $15K without FSD. Is the upgrade worth the price?

I’m a bit scared FSD price is going to continue to go up. I trust that it will continue to get better over time, and I love trying on new things. Based on what I've seen at its current state, I don't think FSD is worth its price but I'd rather not pay more down the road for it.",teslamotors,1573590478,eyeofthelight,0,1,True,2019-11-12

328,"Solar Panels for an older home, needs roof and electrical work.","Hi all,

I live in an older home in northern NJ, outside of the NYC metro area. I believe the home was built in the 1930's. As a result, things are ""dated"" for the most part, but both our predecessors and my family has done some renovations.

We currently have 100 Ampere service for our electricity. Our stove/range, clothes dryer, water heater, and heat (steam boiler) are powered by gas. We added central air conditioning last year that is strictly AC (no heat pump), and we're pretty maxed in terms of circuits for the breaker box.

My roof is also somewhere around 10-15 years old, so I am expecting that this needs to be replaced for my solar panels. I'm also hoping to buy a Tesla in about 2 years when my current lease ends, unless they're willing to buy me out for nearly everything remaining on the car. Unfortunately, I got a really, really good deal on my lease so I doubt the dealerships would be interested in the buyout. So, in 2 years, I am hoping to buy an AWD version of the Model Y or the Model 3. This will require me to upgrade my electric service most likely, to 200 amperes, and run the 240V line. I'd almost certainly go with the Tesla Wall Connector for my charging solution, unless it's suggested to go with a competitor brand (Chargepoint, etc.) because of compatibility. As it stands now, my wife is very content driving her Honda Pilot, and it's only 3 years old, so it should have lots of life left in it - it's not like we need to charge 2 different makes of EV's.

My electric usage is about 25 kW per day. The medium system says it'll generate around 19-27 kWh per day, and the large system says 28-41 kWh per day. Since I'm anticipating adding an EV to the mix, I'm estimating that I'll be increasing my electric demand by about 25% (my commute is 10 miles each way, I typically drive less than 1000 miles per month total.) which would mean about 31 kW per day.

I'm leaning towards Large, as a result.

My utility does Net Metering, so I was planning to skip the Powerwall installation and focus in the biggest solar system I was comfortable paying for right now. We don't have Time of Use, so there's no use in scheduling overnight charging for financial reasons (but I understand the concept behind pre-conditioning the cabin/battery before driving in the morning). Also, my electricity is very reliable: Aside from Hurricane Sandy in 2012, we really haven't lost power at all, knock on wood, not even for a minute.

Fortunately, I have a north/south facing roof, in an inverted ""v"", so that seems ideal for the solar. I'm looking to have it installed in January or later of 2020.

This will give me the 26% federal tax credit. NJ also has ""SRECs"" that sell for, give or take, around $200 per unit. I have a competitor's quote that suggests the medium-comparable system would produce about 9 of these SREC's per year, bringing me in an extra $1800. The SREC benefit lasts for 10 years after system turn on, which would bring me in around $18,000.

It appears that the Tesla site would only bring in around $6200 in SREC's. I'm not sure why this is so low in comparison, like if they're taking a fee to exchange the SREC's, or if they're just lowballing the generation rate. The SREC's will have a big part in this, as I will be paying down my Home Equity Loan.

Payment is my last topic, whereas I don't know if Tesla finances these to me, and at what rates, but I'm prepared to draw out of my Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) to pay for these, and then use the Federal Tax Credit (won't get until April 2021, since it's the 2020 year return), and any income from SREC's, to pay this down until it goes away. Also, will be making payments to the HELOC with ""what would have been"" my electricity bill of $150/mo towards the HELOC balance until paid in full as well.

So, I'm assuming that Tesla will give me a price for the roof, large breaker box, 200 Amp service upgrade, and the panels themselves. Is there anything else I might be forgetting or any other gotcha's I should be aware of before I pull the trigger? The SREC thing seems to be the most vague.

The main reason I love the Tesla panel solution so much is the app is nice to look at, and I'd like keeping things simplified using one app (in the future, with an EV)

339,I think messed up,"No, I **know** I messed up.

The lease on my BMW 3-series was up. A lease I wanted to get out from under for years. I sort of impulse-leased a convertible. I do love the car, but then the article came out, the one about the guy who got to 100k miles on his model 3 using purely supercharging.

I had been writing off a Tesla as impossible because I didn't have a driveway. But I do have this: reliable parking, a short stop-and-go commute, AND a supercharger that's walkable from work. The last thing I have is some unusual flexibility in my life. There are plenty of days where I can go in early or late, and it's totally ok for me to disappear for hours at a time some days. I'm a professor- as long as my classes get taught and my work gets done, nobody cares where I am at any given moment. 

I started my trip odometer last Monday morning and just broke 100 miles. I can easily imagine that today, when i only have a class at night, I could have headed in an hour or two early, hit up the supercharger to top off to 80% while I have a coffee with my laptop, and then hop over to the school garage 2 minutes away when done. 

So the sudden change was that article made me realize what I could be getting with that money, and suddenly it feels like a much worse deal driving what I am.

I'm bad at arithmetic (a form of discalculia), and got into the BMW cycle when I was depressed in grad school and really needed to exert some agency over my life. Since then, I haven't treated cars like a major purchase. I want it done so quickly I just do it and don't haggle. I only threatened to leave once, my first BMW lease, and that one ended up pretty damn affordable. The lease I'm in now is much less transparent, and will cost the entire sticker price of the car by the time I'm done. Yes, I feel like I let myself get ripped off (which is not what I'm here to talk about) but coupled with the guilt that I could be giving that money to Tesla to OWN a car that does everything I want... that feels like a personal failure. 

I can afford the lease I have, but for that money, I could be getting so much more. Like no carbon emissions and four-wheel drive and a panoramic roof that I won't worry about in the winter. Oh, and Sirius XM radio reception SUCKS in my brand-new car. It's so overcompressed!

374,Winter tips,I know that regenerative braking does not work during cold weather. Today in NYC it was about 36 and I precondition my car for about 10 mins. Car was nice and warm but the regenerative braking is still limited. How long should I precondition for? And should I set my charging time later and limit the amps so when it done charging the battery is warmed up and will start to precondition. I waste about 30 miles a day on my battery even though I drive like 15 miles. I have the Tesla home charger that charges about 30 miles an hour.

375,Why is there no ability to schedule departure time from the mobile app,"Tesla finally allows us to schedule departure times with 2019.36 but you have to schedule it all from the car instead of from the convenience of inside your home (or anywhere else) with the app. Does anyone know why they won’t change this? 

I know this is the very definition of a first world problem but I didn’t understand it when you could delay charging to start at a certain time and I don’t understand it now when you can have charging scheduled to be finished by a certain time. 

Seems like it would be a very simple add that would help those that need to change the departure time often enough that going out to the car every time becomes an annoyance.",teslamotors,1573614326,idealdreams,34,1,True,2019-11-12

I tried it with Regen set to Low, then with Regen set to Standard. Low Regen + Hold Mode is okay but I prefer the Standard Regen + Hold combination. The quicker onset of the more powerful standard regen braking at higher speeds hands off nicely to the Hold mode braking taking over at 5 mph down. It continues linearly to a full stop.  I normally prefer Low Regen + Roll mode but with this new combination it brings a new and enjoyable driving experience. There are six combinations possible now and should fit most preferences: \[Low or Standard Regen\] x \[Creep, Roll, or Hold\].  It's very well done and hats off the software and driving dynamics team. It would come close to perfect once we get the full spectrum combinations of \[None (coast) , Low, Medium, &amp; High Regen\] x \[Creep, Roll, or Hold\].

397,Want to buy a Model 3. Have concerns about local charging infrastructure.,"I'll get it out of the way right off: I am pretty low income, so this possibility is a pretty new idea to me and I am trying to determine how valid my concerns are about my desire to purchase a Model 3.   


A little background: I make around $20k per year, but I have moderately good credit at around 700 and I am only even able to consider this purchase in the not-so-distant future because I am receiving what I understand to be a relatively significant inheritance from my grandfather's passing that I believe would allow me to pay off what's left of my student loans, handle a handful of minor frivolous purchases, and either make a large down payment on a Model 3 or purchase it right out and still leave enough afterwards to try to start into some form of investments (not the discussion at hand. I'll be looking into that separately). I don't actually know the amount of the inheritance as of yet, but the general impression I have been given is that it should be sufficient for the actual purchase, insurance, and, supposedly, the general upkeep.   


My concern I'm bringing here is about the charging. I live along the Mississippi Gulf Coast (Biloxi/Gulfport area, if anyone feels like checking to see if I have made some sort of mistakes). All told, I probably do 250 miles a week on a typical week (daily commute of 30 miles round trip plus everything else has me refilling my roughly 250 mile range tank about once a week) with some weeks easily topping 300. I've looked at several charging websites and it appears there is pretty poor infrastructure locally; the closest supercharger I'm seeing is 50 miles away (but, there is a single local CHAdeMO/SAE charger that I think would be considered a Level 3 charger about 10 miles from home) and all of the local chargers I see are pretty poorly located for the idea of leaving the car to charge for a couple of hours. Thus, I believe I would be relying hard on home charging. The problem with that idea is that I rent and will be doing so for at least a couple more years, so I don't believe I would be able to have an actual Home Charger installed for the time being. I would be relying pretty strongly on plugging into the sole standard exterior outlet (not sure on whether it could be converted to something more effective; I have doubts), which doesn't sound like an especially advisable situation.  


Now, after that long-winded preamble, my question is just how badly would this charging situation affect the viability of purchasing a Tesla or any other EV?",teslamotors,1573627006,my_research_account,17,1,True,2019-11-13

I love Tesla and I love what Elon is doing to advance electric technology but that doesn't change the fact that ICE cars are also great. The term ""fossil car"" sounds kind of derogatory and some youtubers, not naming any names, act in sort of a rude manner towards Ice cars. I've seen some videos of ev-s being rude against ""fossil"" cars. There was also an instance where a load of Teslas occupied a petrol station and no ICE cars could fill up their tanks, which I think is one of the most idiotic things I've seen, there is no reason for that.

464,Issue with hold mode in latest update,"The first time I drove a Tesla years ago, I fell in love with regen braking right away. About 30 seconds into my drive though, I said to the salesperson that the car should absolutely continue braking to a stop and then automatically apply brake hold. It's so obvious! Needless to say, I was super excited when I heard the option was finally coming in an update.

I finally got the update on my MSP on Monday and I'm disappointed. It needs a lot of work overall and I know Tesla will improve it a lot, however the biggest issue for me is accelerating out of brake hold. With hold mode enabled, there is a noticeable lag between pressing the accelerator and actually accelerating out of brake hold. I feel like I'm in an ICE car again and I'm waiting for fuel to inject, turbo to spool, etc. With hold mode off, accelerating out of brake hold is instant, just as it always was and always should be.

Has anyone else noticed this? I'm bummed because it's a deal-breaker for me and I'm not going to bother adjusting my driving to hold mode until it's fixed.",teslamotors,1573673524,redkemper,36,1,True,2019-11-13

482,Burnt down Tesla in the news,"I’m from Austria and today my father gave me a call, because he saw a guy talking about his Tesla on the TV(ORF: https://tvthek.orf.at/profile/Aktuell-in-Oesterreich/13887571/Aktuell-in-Oesterreich/14031813 at 3:40)
I try to summarize what they said:
•	The owner had a crash and the Tesla began to burn
•	a towing company picked his Tesla up afterwards and tried to get the recycling chain running
•	Tesla stated that they would take care of it in 2/3 days, nothing happened, and they had to contact them again, they referred them to their recycling partner in Austria, (https://www.oecar.at/)*, but they are not allowed to take care of it by now.
•	Other recycling companies in Austria thankfully denied taking care of the car, because of the risks
•	There are two companies in Germany that could do it, but the car is not even allowed to be transported on Austrian streets
•	The status quo is that a technician from Tesla will come from the Netherlands and take care of the batterie, but nobody has tried to get in contact with them since a week.
•	The last statement from the owner is that he fells “let down” and “mucked around” by Tesla and everyone involved
 
*You can see a letter (for a few sec.) where the company states that Tesla is not at fault(they even state that Tesla did never miss a deadline or anything similar) and the government takes an extra-long time to give them approval(since Nov 2018), but this gets never really mentioned in the tv-report, just that they are not approved.

I think I don’t have to mention what kind of picture this draws for my father and all the other people who only know Tesla(or in general an electric car) from TV.

My question is, what is the normal procedure for a case like this in your country?
Maybe someone has more information how this normaly works in Austria or the EU?
How do other carmakers handle this?

493,TeslaCam Video Merger for Non-Tech-Savvy People,"Back in March this year, I saw someone on /r/TeslaModel3 asked for a video merger for their TeslaCam clips. Being familiar with ffmpeg, I personally didn't have a problem merging the videos using my Linux terminal, so I kinda ignored it. But after having to type that command out so many times, I thought to myself it would be nice if I can drag and drop these clips onto some app and have them merged automatically. That's when I decided to take 1 for the team.

**tldr; I made a Merger Web App for those who want to combine their TeslaCam clips to 1 video** [**HERE**](https://teslacam.org/)

Some drawbacks:

* You have to wait for the clips to upload. If your internet connection is slow, it will take a while.
* It will take some time to process the videos. I use ffmpeg so it is very lightweight compared to other software, it still takes about 30-60s to finish processing a video.
* My server is fairly weak and has low storage of 500 GB, so files will be deleted every few hours to save space. If too many people upload at once (which I don't think so) then it will crash and I'll be sad.
* It only supports 1 output format. I will play around for different output types later.

4,Disagreement with EE over safety of EVs/Teslas in the event of power loss,"Hey guys, I know there are a lot of Tesla owners who are also engineers here, so can someone provide me insight into how our cars react in the event of power loss/catastrophic system failure?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a software engineer and I have an electrical engineer coworker who doesn't believe in Teslas/EVs and he recently came up with a strange situation to argue why an EV is not safer than an ICE. According to him, if a car is cruising on the highway and suddenly all power is lost, an ICE has multiple gears that will allow it to keep coasting so you can brake gradually when safe. He claims that in EVs, if power to the high voltage battery is lost, there is suddenly no electricity being provided to the motors to keep spinning and that your car will dangerously and immediately come to a halt in the middle of the road without giving you time to pull over safely. He reiterates that without a safety system, an EV motor brakes when it should be coasting due to the physics of an AC motor versus a geared gas motor.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have much experience with system architecture or electronics but my immediate reaction was that there was no way all these electric vehicles would be legal if such an issue wasn't considered.

Hi everyone, I'm looking into buying a new tesla in December (maybe late November) and wanted to know what car you think would be best for me to get. I mostly want one because I will be living in a bigger city where gas is way too expensive and really bad for the environment. Not only that but I wanted to make future road trips my enjoyable.

A little info:

I'm 25 years old with no children but I do travel mostly with my two younger brothers (both 6ft) frequently.

I like the room of the MX however I've read people talking about how the falcon doors are pretty slow and lose their novelty after a while. While the MS is smaller but provides a better range than the MX. I love the body of the MS but the interior just looks so boring to me but I worry that the MX will make me feel like more of a soccer mom when  I'm not.

Or should I wait to see if the MS really is getting a ""refresh"" along with the new ""plaid"" that's coming?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long ramble. Hopefully, you can see my indecisiveness lol

52,Having regrets on Model 3 order over lack of Android Auto,"I ordered a Model 3 from existing inventory and have delivery in about 2 weeks. Financing is done, insurance is done, and starting the electrical work for a 240v outlet in garage. 

I love everything about what Tesla stands for and overall love the car design and features. The autopilot and full self driving have potential to make my daily commute significantly better (highway, often heavy traffic). 

HOWEVER, I'm kind of freaking out about the lack of Android Auto, which I rely on big time to keep me sane on my driving. I use Audible, Google Podcasts, and Spotify. All work flawlessly with AA and voice control is amazing. I also occasionally use radio.com to stream an out of market station and can actually start that with a voice command to AA too.  I figured I could make due with TuneIn, Slacker and the new Spotify native apps, but in reading more about them, I'm not sure. Also I make phone calls with voice control.

Help talk me off the ledge, I am thinking of cancelling my order. I can Bluetooth audible and radio.com for as often as I use them, but I need Podcasts (open to app selection) and Spotify at working levels. How is voice control in the model 3?  I am going to make a major shift only to be hugely disappointed??m",teslamotors,1570791530,js66174003342,82,0,True,2019-10-11

I want a high performance car that isn't either a tricked out hot-hatch or is impractical like a sports car. I've done the BMW thing and they're fun but not for me. 

So, I've been thinking about a Tesla. Model 3 or S? Not sure which. But beyond that, I can't even make heads or tails about the purchase process. I'm used to haggling with dealers and cross-shopping them to get the best deal. That doesn't seem possible with the Tesla. Is that correct? 

Buy or lease? Honestly, the tech is so new, I'm not sure I want to buy. Plus Musk seems like a nut job who could take this company down with him in a blaze of manic energy. So leasing. I know the ins-and-outs of leasing a vehicle and I don't love leasing unless it makes financial sense. But what's out there right now as far as promos go?

I know I'm going to get some biased views and that's totally cool. Thanks for any advice you can give!",teslamotors,1570804731,3dprinth3lp,174,42,True,2019-10-11

It didn't sound right at all, and no amount of messing with gain or low-pass filter could fix it.

I finally sat down and learned how to use a DSP. The good news is that subwoofers in the Model 3 *can* be tuned to sound **amazing**. I've done all the legwork and I provide you with the only file you need. This mod will run you about $100 bucks, but it's worth *every* penny and I have the science (and photos) to back it up.

86,Transferring vehicle registration of lease Model 3,"I leased my Model 3 in May in my home state. I had to relocate for work last month and moved a state over. I need to transfer the registration on my Model 3 to the new state. I called Tesla Finance and it took me 40 minutes on hold before I was even connected to a person. I explained everything to the rep on the phone and she said it would take 2-4 WEEKS to get me the registration packet I’d need to take to the DMV to get everything started. 

There are two issues here. One, state law requires that new residents transfer their vehicle registration within 20 days of their new residence in the state and two, my home state registration expires in 9 days. 

What are my options to avoid driving around with out a valid registration? I explained the urgency to the rep on the phone but she didn’t seem to care, she just said that they’ll get to me as quickly as they can.

91,"Californians with Powerwall and affected by the pre-emptive blackouts, what was your experience","The pre-emptive blackouts may be the new normal here in California. The perfect storm of high winds, low humidity, and high temperature is forcing PG&amp;E and other CA utilities to take these precautions. Aging power lines  can be downed during these conditions and literally spark a repeat of the 2018 wildfires. 

There's a saying that the best time to fix a leaking roof is five years ago and the next best time is today. Many are outraged that PG&amp;E did not foresee upgrading their aging infrastructure while exiting executives got millions in severance. The cost to individuals and businesses, meanwhile, might be in the hundreds of millions. My power is still out, on it's 2nd day. (On a side note, how are cell towers still able to work? Incredibly cell phone service is fully functional with just a little bit of degradation in signal strength.) I do agree that what PG&amp;E is doing now is the responsible thing to do and there's news that another combination of these weather conditions are in forecast again in the coming weeks. 

With this rant, my aim is to do what I can to be more resilient to these blackouts. I can't rely on PG&amp;E looking out for my best interest but I can't be socialized to accept this as the new normal. I firmly believe that home energy storage + solar is really one the best solutions in becoming resilient to what may be a more common event. I already have a PV array which gets me to almost net zero but it did not help me during the blackout. There was a run on portable generators and you could not find one at Costco, Home Depot, Lowes, Harbor Freight in the entire Bay Area radius. By the way, I did not have any issues charging my Model 3 at a Supercharger while I saw long lines at gas stations.

How much, if any, immunity from the protests and the movement itself does Tesla have? At what point does the ire of the movement turn its gaze upon Tesla, especially with Tesla’s increasingly cozy relationship with the Chinese government? And finally, if the Hong Kong movement continues to escalate and create turmoil in China, what would that man for the economy, and thus the EV market?

I can’t help but think that the longer the Hong Kong movement goes the more power it will have, and the higher the chance of military intervention from China will be, and all of this will intertwine deeply with the economy and markets. As a Hong Kong supporter, I hate to think in terms of “Oh no, Tesla sales and deliveries!” but I cannot help but think of it. Not even getting to what role Tesla has in the increasing ask of corporations to have a purpose beyond shareholder profit (coughourmissioncough) and how it relates to Hong Kong.

109,Autopilot will now merge over when traffic cones close off a lane!,"I just wanted to report what I experienced last night - I’m driving down an interstate, and was in the passing lane.  As the car in front of me merged over, I realize there’s a line of traffic cones that gradually merge my lane over and close it off.  As traffic happened to work out around me - I ended up with no one in the lane to my right and no one behind me for quite a ways, so I decided to see what Autopilot would do.  The last time I tried this was a few months ago, and I was forced to take over at the last second and quickly change lanes.  This time was different.  As soon as the cones started to come into the lane, I noticed autopilot starting to hug the right side of the lane.  Then as the cones kept coming Autopilot used them as a left-side barrier, and it allowed itself to be forced into the next lane!  The next step will be something more proactive - like seeing the lane closure ahead of time and using the turn signal to make a legit lane change, but it was exciting to see Autopilot handle a scenario that it previously couldn’t!  Made my night.

Additional [maybe] relevant info - these traffic cones were of the large, drum-shaped variety.  I’m not sure if it would respond the same way to the smaller type cones.  If you test this yourself it goes without saying - be extremely careful!  Or just don’t.  I’m not sure how the car would have reacted if there had been traffic to my right or if there would have been a Semi 2 lanes over, etc.",teslamotors,1570816010,Setheroth28036,33,74,True,2019-10-11

A Chevy Volt had the Clipper Creek and I took the first of the two Tesla DCs with my Model 3.  The parking lot was very full, to the point that people were parking on the grass, but thus far, people had resisted the temptation to ICE the EV spots.  As I was walking away from the spot, a Karen from Central Casting pulled her Subaru into the other Tesla DC spot.  I stopped and glared and shook my head.  And I actually won this battle of wills.  Maybe she thought that I'd report her to the front desk and have her car towed.  (The first part of that would definitely have happened, no clue about the second.) She pulled out and parked somewhere else.  About an hour later, I spotted another Model 3 in the other DC spot, so I successfully saved that spot for someone who would use it properly.

166,A Couple Quick Owner Questions,"Hello everyone,

A few months ago people were posting that they bought a Tesla during February of this year and were given the FSD option for free (it was promised to some, I had not heard of it when I bought my model 3 in Feb) but it had taken months for the upgrade to show onto their account.  Oddly enough right before all these posts showed up I received an email saying I could buy FSD for 3K, which I did.  

Has anyone had success getting a return on their money for buying an option that they were already promised?  I wrote Tesla several times concerning this issue but never got a response from them. 

My second question is at what speed does the Model 3 LR AWD have the best efficiency?

I have 2 questions. How can I utilize this time that I have, for the maximum experience? What all should i do? I will pick up the car Sat 6 pm and return Monday am. I am in Philadelphia PA. And I was thinking of a quick road trip with the family. Where can i go, especially for the fall foliage. 

Also, a follow up question. What is the longest road trip you've made with your Tesla? 

Did you ever have to choose a hotel that you weren't planning on staying in, just becuase it had supercharging? 

What are the logistics of planning a road trip involving multiple nights in terms of charging the car?

185,Idea: CHAdeMO / CCS chargers that also have a Tesla adapter,"Since Tesla is selling the CHAdeMO adapter now, and possibly in the future the CCS adapter, I imagine it will only be a matter of time before we start seeing CHAdeMO / CCS to Tesla adapters provided at the charging station. This would bring a lot more Tesla owners to the stations. Only problem I see is controlling the adapter so people don't steal it.

There are a lot of places, especially the Western US that need DC fast chargers, but Tesla is probably never going to put in superchargers (Ely, NV; McCall, ID; McDermott, NV; Stanley, ID to name a few). It's a whole lot easier for a business to install CHAdeMO / CCS fast chargers on their property than to get Tesla to install superchargers.

I do find it surprising gas stations aren't putting in CHAdeMO / CCS chargers yet for travelers, like Circle K does in Norway. I guess it's the chicken and the egg problem, people don't want to drive to these locations with an ev, and businesses in these locations don't want to install chargers unless there are EVs there (which people living there aren't going to be charging at the public chargers anyway).",teslamotors,1570864114,gakio12,28,17,True,2019-10-12

243,"Thinking about leasing a M3 -- [this'll be my first car, I have some questions]","Howdy. As the title states, I'm thinking about leasing a Model 3, and this is my first car, so I want to make sure I think through all the variables before I actually sign on the dotted line.

Summary:

* 32M in Chicago
* Looking at a Long Range AWD
* Going to put maybe 10k miles/year on it
* Planning to **not** get a home charger since I rent
* Will be stored in a somewhat heated parking garage (usually about 30 degrees warmer than ambient outside when it's cold)
* Not getting the full self-driving since it's a lease and it stays with the car, not my account
* Never needed a car before because I can walk to work, but I've been driving since 16

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

1. What are other people's experiences without having a home charger? I understand it loses 1-3%/day depending on the temp, but I figure that I wouldn't have a gas pump in my house, and there are many chargers/superchargers nearby
2. Did anyone here have a Tesla in Chicago during the Polar Vortex last year when it was -50F? How much did that affect the battery performance?
3. Do I need to worry about using non-Tesla charging stations? Eg, can one give the car the wrong amperage or something and mess up the battery or brick the car?
4. Is there any kind of routine maintenance besides rotating the tires? Eg, do I need to discharge most of the battery and recharge it to full every so often?
5. If my AWD gets towed by the city and they don't use a flatbed (since I don't think the city of Chicago even *has* flatbed towers), what do I do? (in before ""just don't get towed"")
6. What's the approximate monthly cost for the data the car consumes for software updates, navigation, etc?
7. About how often do software updates get published? (My wifi doesn't reach my building's parking garage)
8. What other question(s) should I be asking that I haven't considered?

279,Why increasing the price of FSD and lowering the cost of cars is the right strategy.,"We all see this from the customer's point of view, I'm attempting to explain my understanding of Tesla's point of view.

Tesla expect to have a fully functioning FSD Robo-Taxi solution working ""soon"".

In that case the relevant questions in terms of valuing FSD are:-

1. Will Tesla eventually have a working Robo-Taxi solution?
2. How soon will that be ready?
3. How long am I keeping my car?
4. Would I ever use my car as a Robo-Taxi?
5. What could a Robo-taxi earn per year?

I'll cut to the chase and say my conservative estimate of the value of FSD software in a working Robo-Taxi is 30K, based on the fact that a working Robo-taxi should be able to earn 10k per year.

Where customers  may struggle to see value is if they only ever intend to use the car and FSD privately. In that case I would hope the laws in most jurisdictions  would allow something like the following split, FSD for private use 10K, upgrade to Robo-Taxi 20K. 

Elon and Tesla have clearly signalled their intention to have a working Robo-Taxi solution, and to keep increasing the price of FSD. While that may not be popular, as far as I can tell that is the intention, and baring the occasional need for a sales push to bring in more revenue, I don't see that changing. 

Even if this true we need to consider the questions above in particular ""How soon will that be ready?"", my fairly conservative guess is 5 years...  everyone has their own guess.

So that is the bad news, if you are betting against FSD prices increases, IMO you are probably wrong.

Obviously this is a demand lever to get people off the fence, but that is another reason why I think they will try stick to the plan.

There is good news on price.

IMO the aim is still for a 35K base Model 3 ASAP, increase FSD prices/take rate will help that process, specifically I think Tesla can eventually progressively eat the 2K cost of base autopilot dropping the cost of packs and making a slightly smaller pack may do most of the rest.

 Low price is important because that allows high volumes of production which in turn means more Robo-taxis,  and a lower priced fleet. Again my guess is that in a fully-saturated market Robo-taxi's will charge $1 per mile and make $30 per day.  How do you think the Waymo business model stacks up? 

The reason for low earnings is, Robo-taxis need to be available when customers want them at maximum convenience, that means a fair amount of idle time.

My other thought is China is the perfect place to design and build a 20K Tesla in about 5 years time, again in high volume that is a perfect Robo-taxi for inner city environments, at low cost, and maximum customer convenience.

So in summary lower priced cars and higher priced FSD are what I think Tesla intends, if is the right strategy for them even if it is mixed news for customers...

It is good news for early adopters of FSD who helped fund the development, and have been patiently waiting for results.",teslamotors,1570926549,M3FanOZ,85,24,True,2019-10-12

**My two questions are:**

1. How bad is it during winter without having a heated steering wheel? My 2015 KIA Forte has it and it literally is one of my all time favourite features especially winter time. So I'm wondering if ever any of you considered the 3 yet chose not to proceed with it because of that one convenience aspect of having a heated steering wheel.
2. This is the main question really. I will need to commute to the US at least 2-3 times a month for work. It's around 550km one way. I don't have an issue driving for 5hrs or even worry about having to Supercharge on the way back and forth. However, does it make sense to own a Tesla while racking up all that mileage? Or should I just keep using my current vehicle until it breaks before considering to switch to an Electric Alternative, from a mileage perspective.

Just came across this. I have so many questions. How can you check if your mcu is running the way it should be? Are there any warnings that shows your mcu might be failing due to corrupt memory? The problem is known and Elon even acknowledges it by saying it should be better now. But what if the damage has already been done and the memory is nearing the end of its life? It seems that it takes awhile before the memory fails. Chances of it failing during warranty seems pretty low. Is it fair to charge someone for a problem that is already known?

314,Smart Summon Tips?,"Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

Now that we have had Smart Summon for a few weeks, any good tips on when to and how to use it?

Here are a few of mine.

Smart Summon is terrible for coming to the door. It drives on the wrong side, blocks up the lane, cuts across things, and generally blocks up the parking lot. However, it is GREAT at pulling out of a space and just into the aisle. I like to have it pull out and forward a bit, then jump in and drive off - actually a time saver. 

If the parking lot is super busy (like the local grocery store), I generally avoid using it as it will block things up and make me look like an \*\*\*hole. But in a less crowded lot or one that has currently died down, it actually is a benefit.

I am wondering if there is something I can do to make it easier/faster. I have PIN to drive enabled but now that is a liability. If I pull the car into the aisle, I really need to get in and go, now stop to enter a pin. I tried using the remote start with fingerprint but the summon reinstates the PIN. I wish smart summon would disable that (which doesn't seem like a huge risk - the geofencing tells it you are close and the fact that you are commanding it means you are aware). 

I have also had to stop using a sun visor on the car, since that is one more thing that I need to take down when the car is in an aisle (and just my luck, someone will suddenly be right behind me trying to get out and I don't want to be rude). 

I know a lot of people prefer to use the pin drop vs the ""come to me"" so they can see the route. However, then you don't get the radar view. I wish you would see both when you push the button (""Come to Me"" shows a mini map with the route, drop pin shows the radar when held). 

There is more room for app updates here as well. I wish there were widgets (I am on Android) that could be used so I don't have to go into the app and wait for things. It would be particularly good if there was a widget or shortcut to ""Prepare your Vehicle"" which would do things like turn on the a/c and wake everything up so it is ready for smart summon while I walk into range. It would also be great if I could do this from my watch - save me getting out my phone and having to play with it. 

So far, I am starting to like Smart Summon. I think the initial roll-out of it has been a bit more of ""cool trick"" vs. ""useful feature"" but there is real value there. Pulling out of a spot really can be a time saver, and I am sure once they work out more of the driving logic, coming to the front door could be regularly useful. Maybe they could figure out a way to identify loading zones better, so it can pull into just the right place (and not hold up an entire parking lot). It is promising.",teslamotors,1570968208,Kri77777,0,1,True,2019-10-13

My point is that at this rate, the car could sit for maybe 9 days under these conditions and I would not be any more anxious about dead batteries than I would be over flat tires. Am I missing something? (Assume 310 Max charge *0.9 - 60 reserve miles = 9 days)?

OTOH, when it's parked in the sun with temps in the 90’s with Sentry and COP on, I lose about 2 miles an hour so 5 days of sitting will eat into my 60 mile reserve range?",teslamotors,1570989240,NeedMoreGrits,1,0,True,2019-10-13

356,"semi totals my model 3 -- no footage saved, remote videos are not a thing","I'm working this via phone w/ my husband whom was just hit by a semi somewhere near Ohio and Detroit.. the model 3 I'm told is totaled -- after it went spinning and is now in many pieces, no longer resembles a car.  Thankfully nobody was even bruised in the slightest.

&amp;#x200B;

The state police are on sight investigating, the trucker is trying to say it wasn't his fault, etc.  I'm told the state trooper sounds reasonable in understanding what actually happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure whether we have footage or not. At first glance *it seems not though*.  I call Tesla emergency roadside up to try and inquire about safely ejecting the USB drive and whether they received remote video footage. The roadside assistance people were only able to tell me if Sentry mode was on before I was driving, and if the USB drive was in, the footage would be saved. **She wasn't able to tell me the procedure to properly eject the USB drive and not cause data loss/corruption,** I asked her to look this up, asked her to ask a supervisor, etc. S**he proclaimed this was not a roadside emergency issue and that they didn't have to know that and it's a service center issue,** and that I'd have to wait until Monday morning to be in contact with them. She said if Tesla did have any footage I would have to subpoena them for that.  I asked for a supervisor, I'm told they will call me back, still waiting, waiting on the phone for them was not an option. We did eject but now it seems we don't have the footage.

&amp;#x200B;

I find it irresponsible, and more importantly *negligent*, that Tesla roadside assistance doesn't have this basic information available for this basic procedure.  If i just pull the drive out there will likely be data loss. If I wait until Monday, the buffer for non saved events  (the last 4 hours of camera footage, last I had looked) will have already been lost. Anyway that all aside..  I asked the call taker to put in an explicit ticket to her manager requesting that they needed this information, she was ambivalent and would not, said it's not a roadside emergency. I told her to make sure the copy of the call was preserved as it might be subpoenaed too.

&amp;#x200B;

Having the frunk not open and being unable to get it scheduled with service for 3 months is one thing, but this is a whole other level of Tesla's customer service experience.

401,"I am researching a Powerwall, and I am confused about the impact of rebates and ability to use as we want to. (California)","Ideally, the best person to respond would be someone who has a Powerwall in California, who claimed the federal and state incentives to fund their energy project. But if anyone else is familiar with the matter, please feel free to comment.

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to convince my parents to get a Powerwall for our home, and I'm trying to do the math to see if we can afford it. They are opposed to loans, but I did tell them I'd loan them a few thousand until they could pay it back, they're opposed to that too, but I'm sure I could convince them. Their budget is $3,000. (Could be $6,000 with my personal loan). Here's two things that alone would make this affordable: The federal ITC rebate (Currently 30%, likely 26% when/if we had the Powerwall installed), and the California SGIP rebate that can be used for energy storage. 

Here's what our energy usage looks like. Our cooking, heating, and clothes dryer are natural gas, so they don't put a lot of load on electricity usage, which also means our energy usage is fairly consistent and predictable. 

My PG&amp;E off peak rates are from 12AM to 3PM ($0.16), peak is 4-9PM($0.47), and the other 4 hours are $0.36) Our winter peak is $0.34, but our solar outputs more in the summer, so average rates per kWh in total are similar throughout the year. If we can get the SGIP and ITC incentives, then I am almost certain we could afford this project. 

What I have figured out is that one Powerwall should be enough to run the basics in our house for a day, such as food storage, some lights, water pump, and cooking/heating (Since they use natural gas for fuel), especially when paired with our solar, which might let us go for a few days if we are very conservative with energy use and the weather is good. More than enough. However, there is the possibility of getting two, if it makes economic sense (Such as charging the powerwall on a sunny day with solar from 11-3, then discharging from 3-9 (Peak rates). That would cost about $2.1 to charge, but save me $6.3 ($5 factoring efficiency) during peak hours, a savings of about $2.9. That would make me $360 in summer peak hours (4 months), and $385 in winter peak hours (8 months). $700 in yearly energy savings. This only works if I can charge my powerwall from the grid, but when I was reading about the rebates, people were saying you don't have this type of control over your powerwall if you want to qualify for the incentives.

* Is it true that in order to qualify for ITC and/or SGIP, that you don't have full control over the powerwall to save you the most money from charging at off peak and using during peak?

Here are my questions for my calculations:

* Does the federal ITC rebate cover just the powerwall itself? Or the total cost? Such as other equipment, installation costs, permits, and taxes too? I tried googling that, and some sites say the ITC covers ""total cost"" but I don't know what 'total cost' means. Everything? Or just total equipment cost?
* The California rebate is what I'm very confused about. From what I've read, Tesla maxed out the rebate, and I must go through a 3rd party in order to qualify. But when looking into that, I've seen many people say 3rd party installers that do qualify for these rebates often mislead customers by including the value of the rebate in the quote, or they claim it. I'm not sure about the truthfulness of these claims, so I'd love to see if anyone has first hand experience with the SGIP with Tesla (if that's even possible anymore) or a 3rd party.

427,Winter is coming!,"Winter we have cold and new Tesla owners that have never had a Tesla when it's cold. Welcome new owners. You all will be seeing different things happen to your cars. 

I'll start with Model S and X owners. You guys have heaters for the battery pack. This means the car will heat up faster and heat the battery pack. If the battery is cold you won't have regen. That's right you may not get a green bar when you let go of the pedal to slow down. So yes you will have to use that brake and no one pedal driving. The car will have to heat up the battery pack to allow for regen. The way to see if your pack is cold is to look and see if you have yellow dotted lines. You can find the dotted lines the same place as the green bar for regen. 

The way to remove the dotted lines is to make sure the car is plugged in. Preheat the car for at least half an hour (30 mins). This is why you always have to be plugged in. ABC always be charging. If the car is plugged in it will take power from the wall. If the power is not enough it will draw from the pack as well.

*Chicago had a really cold winter. I was not able to change at night. It was taking forever and never got to 90% charge. I found out that when I got home from work that's when it was best to start charging because the battery pack was warmed up from the drive home. This allowed me to finally get a full charge.*  

If you are going on a quick run to a store and don't want to burn a lot of juice turn on range mode. This will limit the heat to the cabin and battery pack. You don't need to spend a lot of energy on heating that stuff if your going to be quick. Now if you want to say fuck that and be warm then keep it off. Make sure to always keep the climate control on after leaving the car to enter the store or whatever. This will keep the car warm and keep the pack heater on. 

*I went out to dinner and left the climate control on for 3 hours while in the restaurant. Yes it did draw a lot of battery power but the pack was heated up and ready to go. The cabin was warm and felt so good.*

Model 3 owners you do not have a pack heater. Tesla will stall the motor to heat the pack. This takes a lot longer than you would think. Make sure to preheat at least an hour. My friends from last year in Chicago did 2 hours of preheating before leaving work and going to the car. This allowed all the snow and ice to melt off.

Model 3 owners will also have the same problems with regen. You will see right under your speed number or P R N D. You will have dotted lines. That is the same as the S and X. It will be harder for the model 3 to heat up and give you regen since the model 3 does not have a battery pack heater. Make sure to preheat and charge to 90%.

If you park outside make sure to preheat and stay plugged in all the time! Make sure you cover your car this will help with ice build up around the charge port, door handles, and windows. PREHEAT!

440,Gifting my mom a Model X,"Hey Tesla Fans!

So my mom really wants a Model X, but is trying to retire soon and doesn’t want the debt of buying a new car. She currently has an (2016/17 not sure the year) Audi Q7, but she always says the car she buys will be a Tesla. I would love to buy her an X because I know it’s her dream car and want her to have the same joy that I get everyday from my 3. I just have a few questions about gifting a Tesla. Here are some of the prerequisites:

1. I can afford it and would insure she had no additional debt. Would also pay off the car at purchase so no loan needed. 

2. I would like it to be a surprise if possible

3. She would trade in her Audi

My questions are:

1. Are there any taxes associated with a gift like this (guessing yes, I live in TN if that helps)?

2. How can I buy the car and have it delivered to her and have everything in her name?

3. How can I have her car valued for trade in secretly?

4. Can I use my own referral code too get it for her?

5. Any good tips of getting her feed back on some of the design without her knowing? (Mainly color and interior feature wise I know what she wants)

6. Is there anything else that I’m currently not considering?

454,Purchasing a Model 3,"Hello!

I'm looking at investing in a Tesla Model 3. I know that rates are said to the same all around for everyone but I'm wondering if anyone knows any way to actually save?

I understand that a new one is around $38,990 + Title/Tax/Fees + FSD ($6000 until Nov 1 - then goes up to $7,000).

I also know that EOQ discounts or incentives are common.

I need help weighing my options.

**- Purchase before Nov 1** \- save on FSD upgrade cost; get $1,875 tax incentive.

**- After Nov 1** but before end of the year - 2019 model; get $1,875 tax incentive; $1000 more for FSD; POSSIBLE EOQ incentive.

**- Jan 1:** No tax incentive, increased FSD cost; and not EOQ incentive - but new model .

&amp;#x200B;

**My questions**

\- (1) How do I get the best deal on my car? I know there are not any negotiations - but can I get a practically new car by asking Tesla rep (i.e. is there a secret inventory for inventory/showroom cars) or is everything available online?

37,How much can spinning a tire in wet gravel damage it?,"My partner and I are vacationing in the mountains and were heading towards our AirBnB outside of the main city, which was up a hill that had a gravel path. It had stormed the previous night so the rain had washed some of the gravel away leaving some exposed rocks and left patches of wet gravel and what I guess could be called mud. At a certain point, the driver-side tire was spinning in the wet gravel/mud and we weren't moving forward. I tried other gears (front wheel automatic, btw) and attempting (probably very poorly) the rocking method, but it didn't work. Shortly after I noticed a burning smell, which seemed like a burning rubber smell. We gave up right after that and made our way back into the city; nothing out of the ordinary with the car that I can tell and it seems normal. 

I can't stop worrying about that tire, though, and keep wondering if I seriously damaged it. My girlfriend thinks it looks fine but that isn't helping my anxiety much. Any help easing my troubled mind? I should be able to provide pictures if necessary. 

Sorry if I'm being overly paranoid, but we're six hours away from home and I don't want to put us in danger by blowing out a tire and spinning out off the side of a mountain.

59,"A random (hopefully funny/entertaining) tale about a young man, a Chevy Spark, a few life lessons, and a car accident.","So this was about a year and a half ago. I was 21 and desperate to get CHEAP/new car. First of all let me start off by saying I was young and dumb (still young and dumb). I tend to make irrational and quick decisions when i’m excited about something. For personal reasons that I don’t wanna get into I was not able to receive a license until I was 21. So when I finally got my license I needed, let me re-phrase that...had the biggest urge/desire to buy a car like the day before my license came in the mail. Also getting a car would allow me to start a new career.

Now for financial, and impatient reasons I was going to finance the car. Now when I say finance I really mean have the LOWEST monthly payment possible. My job requires me to drive 100-200+ miles a day mostly highways so leasing was out of the question. I also did not, and still do not want to buy used. Which is a whole separate argument for a whole different day. Anyway I was literally looking for the cheapest 2018 model car ever created. 

It’s a week before fourth of July and the cheapest car I could find was a 2018 Chevy Spark for around 13k. I figured what the hell I’ve waited 21 long years on my skateboard I can wait another week to try and get the “fourth of July deals” to increase my wheel size from 59mm to 200mm. 

Boom after checking “cars.com” everyday, on July 7th 2018 I pull up with my dad to a chevy dealership 90 miles away from home. Me, feeling like a Russian mobster (I’m Russian haha) on the outside, and as excited as a young school girl on the inside walk inside with my dad. I pull out my phone and show the sales guy the ad I saw. 2018 Chevy Spark for $10,001 in a lightish blue. 

Keep in mind I did NO research. I read NO reviews. My mind was set on this Chevy Spark. You could tell me 9/10 Chevy Sparks are reported to have a mind of their own and drive off of cliffs at 50k miles and I would still buy it without a second thought. 

Now I’m sure all of you can relate to a certain degree. You know the feeling of being so damn excited for something. The feeling of wanting something so damn bad that you would do irrational things to get it. In that moment you don’t want to hear anything negative about your decision. You just want IT. At the time it was the only thing I could afford so in my mind it was either the Chevy Spark or never drive a car again in my whole life. 

Back to the dealership, the sales guy asked if I wanted to test drive it, and for that 90 second circle in the parking lot (I didn’t even take my time I just wanted to get back and sign the paperwork) I fell in love what felt like for the first time. I didn’t even fall in love with the car I fell in love with the feeling of driving hopefully my neat future car. 

This is a Chevy Spark LS. I’m talkin manual windows, no power locking, no center console, cheap speakers, feel ever pebble on the road, get blown off the highway when a gust of wind or even ANY car passes by. I’m talkin a car that teaches you what claustrophobia is. A car that feels like you’re sitting inside one of those electric cars for toddlers. You get the point this was a bare skeleton with a piece of plastic around it. But I loved it. 

I had pretty good credit at the time so I was able to finance my first big purchase. 7.9 APR at 178 a month. At the time thats literally all I could afford. Ya know with insurance being so stupidly expensive if you’re young. So after a long day of paperwork and the sales guy telling us he literally can’t even drop a penny off the price I drove my baby home. 

Fast forward to January 1st 2020 around 5pm: “DAD I NEED YOU TO COME TO ME I JUST SLAMMED INTO A PARKED CAR GOING 60”

Okay okay I know you’re excited to hear what happens next but let me back up a little.

For my job I spend A LOT of time on the road and in my car. 200+ miles/6+ hours a day is not uncommon.  I’m about 5’7 and 150 pounds so I’m not the biggest guy. I’m a nice guy, but the Chevy Spark taught me what it feels like to be uncomfortable. It taught me what anxiety is. It taught me that you can have road rage at yourself. 

A little insight on my job; Im an in home sales man for home improvment. The owner of the company I work for (he took a liking to me because he is also Russian) knew I was planning on getting a car. He told me when I get a car he will train me in becoming a sales rep. Promoting me from my position as a telemarketer. So knowing this made me that much more in a rush to buy a car. We drive to appointments everyday, and sometimes just sit in the car to wait/chill in between appointments. So basically 2/3 of the work day is spent in the car, and the work days can sometimes be 9am to 11pm.

Me being naive and irrational did NOT think about these things when purchasing a car. I did NOT realize how important comfort is when sitting in the car all day. Sure the first 6 months I was so excited about having a car that I did not think about these things, but things quickly changed. 

I started to get really angry and started to despise working. I would wake up KNOWING I’m about to be very uncomfortable and annoyed inside of my car. 

Every detail about the car is horrible. My left elbow rested on what felt like rough old cement, and the rigid surface would leave marks on my arm. My right arm would always be itchy from the cheap cloth armrest. My left leg literally had no where to go. THE WORST PART ABOUT THE CAR THOUGH, my left knee would literally almost ALWAYS be touching the manual window roller handle. Half the time the handle was either directly on top of my knee or directly in front of my knee. I had nightmares about crashing the car only because I knew when I did that handle would be the end of my knee. 

There was no storage compartments in the car. I had no where to put my phone, my change, my wallet, anything else comfortably. Because it’s a tiny hatchback my back seats would ALWAYS have to be pushed forward to fit all of my work stuff (giant bags). MEANING I could not push/lean my seat back enough. It was the equivalence to those people in the asian countries that live in the tiny apartments that look lime walk in closets. 

Now I’m a music guy so listening to music is a must. Not even a year and my speakers started to blow... The speakers sounded like an old nokia phone in the first place. Or a better description would be when your earphones break so you have to pull out the old trusty $9 backup earphones from ross. Constantly I would think about installing better speakers but just never got around to me

There are 2 lessons to be learned from this pointless post, but one of them is how important comfort is when picking a car to own. I will now NEVER sacrifice comfort in the future. Not just in a car, but in anything.

Okay now....January 1st 2020 at about 4:30pm on a very main road. My new years resolution was to stop smoking cigarettes so this was day one!

So around that time of year it can get slow for my job. So as a side hustle I started doing Uber Eats. Let me take a quick second to say CHEVY SPARK DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR RIDE SHARING BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE 5 SEATBELTS. I was EXTREMELY mad when I found that out AFTER I bought the car.

Since the car is so uncomfortably small it took many many attempts to find a phone mount/holder that was just okay. I finally found one that required my phone to be right in the middle. Keep in my mind this is my first day using it. Also keep in mind I am Russian and it was just new years. RIP to my liver the night before.

Here I am driving 60 on a very main road. My phone is right in the middle and I’m looking at it trying to figure out where I’m supposed to deliver this burger to. *Uber eats; pick up food from restaurant and deliver to customer* As I’m looking at my phone in the middle, while singing along to my music, most likely thinking about life, 100% hoping my headache would go away, wondering what my girlfriend is doing, admiring how warm my new north face jacket that I just bought is. Basically doing everything but paying attention to the road (And I’m sorry my grammar is getting worse as this post is going its 3am and I stopped caring as much LOL). I’ve been driving for a year and a half now I’m so confident in my self I can drive with my eyes closed using my feet.

Anyway, BAM I look up and my car is basically inside of an Audi SUV. “FUCK!!!!!!” “Fuck fuck fuck fuck” *close my eyes cause its a dream* *open them cause I’m waking up after a nightmare* “FUCK”

This is my first accident. I was going 60mph, at this point I’m completely speechless and very shocked. Every one always told me that car was a death wish but after about 5 seconds of stating in front of me I immediately climb over the airbags and exit the smoking, pulverized hunk of plastic. 

I slammed into a parked car on the right side of the road. Really horrible too, thank you seatbelt. I don’t even know what to do in this situation so I’m dumbfounded. Witnesses are asking if I’m okay I was so all I could say was “yeah I’m okay” 

I called my dad, and after what seemed like a minute he shows up. The owners of the parked car came out of the restaurant all normal accident stuff. I had a sprained finger, bruises yada yada. 

Now my insurance wanted nothing to do with is since I was doing uber. I filed a claim through uber’s insurance and they said I’ll be covered. Awesome, score, BUT I didn’t know what gap insurance was at the time. I failed to do my research which I always end up having to learn a lesson cause of sometimes heedless decisions.

I had 8 thousand left to pay off my car loan and 40k miles on the car. I for sure thought it was over. I was done, game over. Every one told me the insurance would pay me 5 MAYBE 6 thousand for the car leaving my to pay off the rest. 

Now I’m not religious but by some kind of mystical higher power I was blessed. I pretty much hit the jackpot. My payout was $11,200...

I purchased the car for $10,001...

I got my loan payed off AND received about 2k.

Now if that doesn’t scream second chance I don’t know what does.

To wrap up this long long meaningless story I just want to say a few things. 

If you read up to this point I applaud you. It wasn’t a hell of a ride to read this story. It wasn’t the script to the next big summer blockbuster. It was more like, a carnival ride for children ages 3-6. 

But there are some important lessons and morals to be taken from this.
1. Fuck the Chevy Spark
2. Comfort in a vehicle is very important
3 Do your research and please get a car that you will love even 2 years down the line. Get something you like. If you cant afford it wait until you can if you can be patient
4 GAP INSURANCE
5 Don’t make hasty decisions like me

After lots of research I am getting ready to finance a 2020 Toyota Corolla SE next week, and I’m very excited! 

We live and learn. We make mistakes and we learn from them. I know when it comes to stubborn minds like myself we won’t listen/pay attention to advise that much until we have to pay the consequences. I try to listen more and look things into a different perspective as I get older because the older you get past 18 the more bad decisions screw you over. The consequences weren’t as bad as a teenager but now wrong avoidable decisions can really change your life for the worse. Adulting isn’t easy but thats just the game we call life. Goodnight ya’ll I have to be up in about 4 hours to drive my rental 100 miles to go sell some windows.

I dont really want to pay more for shipping than I do the actual product, but I guess if it's the best option then I'll have to do it. I was just wondering what else is out there. Since it's for a vehicle it obviously needs to be paint safe, but idk much about all of this stuff, so please help!!! Thank you very much in advance!!!

64,"A random (hopefully funny/entertaining) tale about a young man, a Chevy Spark, a few life lessons, and a car accident.","So this was about a year and a half ago. I was 21 and desperate to get CHEAP/new car. First of all let me start off by saying I was young and dumb (still young and dumb). I tend to make irrational and quick decisions when i’m excited about something. For personal reasons that I don’t wanna get into I was not able to receive a license until I was 21. So when I finally got my license I needed, let me re-phrase that...had the biggest urge/desire to buy a car like the day before my license came in the mail. Also getting a car would allow me to start a new career.

Now for financial, and impatient reasons I was going to finance the car. Now when I say finance I really mean have the LOWEST monthly payment possible. My job requires me to drive 100-200+ miles a day mostly highways so leasing was out of the question. I also did not, and still do not want to buy used. Which is a whole separate argument for a whole different day. Anyway I was literally looking for the cheapest 2018 model car ever created. 

It’s a week before fourth of July and the cheapest car I could find was a 2018 Chevy Spark for around 13k. I figured what the hell I’ve waited 21 long years on my skateboard I can wait another week to try and get the “fourth of July deals” to increase my wheel size from 59mm to 200mm. 

Boom after checking “cars.com” everyday, on July 7th 2018 I pull up with my dad to a chevy dealership 90 miles away from home. Me, feeling like a Russian mobster (I’m Russian haha) on the outside, and as excited as a young school girl on the inside walk inside with my dad. I pull out my phone and show the sales guy the ad I saw. 2018 Chevy Spark for $10,001 in a lightish blue. 

Keep in mind I did NO research. I read NO reviews. My mind was set on this Chevy Spark. You could tell me 9/10 Chevy Sparks are reported to have a mind of their own and drive off of cliffs at 50k miles and I would still buy it without a second thought. 

Now I’m sure all of you can relate to a certain degree. You know the feeling of being so damn excited for something. The feeling of wanting something so damn bad that you would do irrational things to get it. In that moment you don’t want to hear anything negative about your decision. You just want IT. At the time it was the only thing I could afford so in my mind it was either the Chevy Spark or never drive a car again in my whole life. 

Back to the dealership, the sales guy asked if I wanted to test drive it, and for that 90 second circle in the parking lot (I didn’t even take my time I just wanted to get back and sign the paperwork) I fell in love what felt like for the first time. I didn’t even fall in love with the car I fell in love with the feeling of driving hopefully my neat future car. 

This is a Chevy Spark LS. I’m talkin manual windows, no power locking, no center console, cheap speakers, feel ever pebble on the road, get blown off the highway when a gust of wind or even ANY car passes by. I’m talkin a car that teaches you what claustrophobia is. A car that feels like you’re sitting inside one of those electric cars for toddlers. You get the point this was a bare skeleton with a piece of plastic around it. But I loved it. 

I had pretty good credit at the time so I was able to finance my first big purchase. 7.9 APR at 178 a month. At the time thats literally all I could afford. Ya know with insurance being so stupidly expensive if you’re young. So after a long day of paperwork and the sales guy telling us he literally can’t even drop a penny off the price I drove my baby home. 

Fast forward to January 1st 2020 around 5pm: “DAD I NEED YOU TO COME TO ME I JUST SLAMMED INTO A PARKED CAR GOING 60”

Okay okay I know you’re excited to hear what happens next but let me back up a little.

For my job I spend A LOT of time on the road and in my car. 200+ miles/6+ hours a day is not uncommon.  I’m about 5’7 and 150 pounds so I’m not the biggest guy. I’m a nice guy, but the Chevy Spark taught me what it feels like to be uncomfortable. It taught me what anxiety is. It taught me that you can have road rage at yourself. 

A little insight on my job; Im an in home sales man for home improvment. The owner of the company I work for (he took a liking to me because he is also Russian) knew I was planning on getting a car. He told me when I get a car he will train me in becoming a sales rep. Promoting me from my position as a telemarketer. So knowing this made me that much more in a rush to buy a car. We drive to appointments everyday, and sometimes just sit in the car to wait/chill in between appointments. So basically 2/3 of the work day is spent in the car, and the work days can sometimes be 9am to 11pm.

Me being naive and irrational did NOT think about these things when purchasing a car. I did NOT realize how important comfort is when sitting in the car all day. Sure the first 6 months I was so excited about having a car that I did not think about these things, but things quickly changed. 

I started to get really angry and started to despise working. I would wake up KNOWING I’m about to be very uncomfortable and annoyed inside of my car. 

Every detail about the car is horrible. My left elbow rested on what felt like rough old cement, and the rigid surface would leave marks on my arm. My right arm would always be itchy from the cheap cloth armrest. My left leg literally had no where to go. THE WORST PART ABOUT THE CAR THOUGH, my left knee would literally almost ALWAYS be touching the manual window roller handle. Half the time the handle was either directly on top of my knee or directly in front of my knee. I had nightmares about crashing the car only because I knew when I did that handle would be the end of my knee. 

There was no storage compartments in the car. I had no where to put my phone, my change, my wallet, anything else comfortably. Because it’s a tiny hatchback my back seats would ALWAYS have to be pushed forward to fit all of my work stuff (giant bags). MEANING I could not push/lean my seat back enough. It was the equivalence to those people in the asian countries that live in the tiny apartments that look lime walk in closets. 

Now I’m a music guy so listening to music is a must. Not even a year and my speakers started to blow... The speakers sounded like an old nokia phone in the first place. Or a better description would be when your earphones break so you have to pull out the old trusty $9 backup earphones from ross. Constantly I would think about installing better speakers but just never got around to me

There are 2 lessons to be learned from this pointless post, but one of them is how important comfort is when picking a car to own. I will now NEVER sacrifice comfort in the future. Not just in a car, but in anything.

Okay now....January 1st 2020 at about 4:30pm on a very main road. My new years resolution was to stop smoking cigarettes so this was day one!

So around that time of year it can get slow for my job. So as a side hustle I started doing Uber Eats. Let me take a quick second to say CHEVY SPARK DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR RIDE SHARING BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE 5 SEATBELTS. I was EXTREMELY mad when I found that out AFTER I bought the car.

Since the car is so uncomfortably small it took many many attempts to find a phone mount/holder that was just okay. I finally found one that required my phone to be right in the middle. Keep in my mind this is my first day using it. Also keep in mind I am Russian and it was just new years. RIP to my liver the night before.

Here I am driving 60 on a very main road. My phone is right in the middle and I’m looking at it trying to figure out where I’m supposed to deliver this burger to. *Uber eats; pick up food from restaurant and deliver to customer* As I’m looking at my phone in the middle, while singing along to my music, most likely thinking about life, 100% hoping my headache would go away, wondering what my girlfriend is doing, admiring how warm my new north face jacket that I just bought is. Basically doing everything but paying attention to the road (And I’m sorry my grammar is getting worse as this post is going its 3am and I stopped caring as much LOL). I’ve been driving for a year and a half now I’m so confident in my self I can drive with my eyes closed using my feet.

Anyway, BAM I look up and my car is basically inside of an Audi SUV. “FUCK!!!!!!” “Fuck fuck fuck fuck” *close my eyes cause its a dream* *open them cause I’m waking up after a nightmare* “FUCK”

This is my first accident. I was going 60mph, at this point I’m completely speechless and very shocked. Every one always told me that car was a death wish but after about 5 seconds of stating in front of me I immediately climb over the airbags and exit the smoking, pulverized hunk of plastic. 

I slammed into a parked car on the right side of the road. Really horrible too, thank you seatbelt. I don’t even know what to do in this situation so I’m dumbfounded. Witnesses are asking if I’m okay I was so all I could say was “yeah I’m okay” 

I called my dad, and after what seemed like a minute he shows up. The owners of the parked car came out of the restaurant all normal accident stuff. I had a sprained finger, bruises yada yada. 

Now my insurance wanted nothing to do with is since I was doing uber. I filed a claim through uber’s insurance and they said I’ll be covered. Awesome, score, BUT I didn’t know what gap insurance was at the time. I failed to do my research which I always end up having to learn a lesson cause of sometimes heedless decisions.

I had 8 thousand left to pay off my car loan and 40k miles on the car. I for sure thought it was over. I was done, game over. Every one told me the insurance would pay me 5 MAYBE 6 thousand for the car leaving my to pay off the rest. 

Now I’m not religious but by some kind of mystical higher power I was blessed. I pretty much hit the jackpot. My payout was $11,200...

I purchased the car for $10,001...

I got my loan payed off AND received about 2k.

Now if that doesn’t scream second chance I don’t know what does.

To wrap up this long long meaningless story I just want to say a few things. 

If you read up to this point I applaud you. It wasn’t a hell of a ride to read this story. It wasn’t the script to the next big summer blockbuster. It was more like, a carnival ride for children ages 3-6. 

But there are some important lessons and morals to be taken from this.
1. Fuck the Chevy Spark
2. Comfort in a vehicle is very important
3 Do your research and please get a car that you will love even 2 years down the line. Get something you like. If you cant afford it wait until you can if you can be patient
4 GAP INSURANCE
5 Don’t make hasty decisions like me

After lots of research I am getting ready to finance a 2020 Toyota Corolla SE next week, and I’m very excited! 

We live and learn. We make mistakes and we learn from them. I know when it comes to stubborn minds like myself we won’t listen/pay attention to advise that much until we have to pay the consequences. I try to listen more and look things into a different perspective as I get older because the older you get past 18 the more bad decisions screw you over. The consequences weren’t as bad as a teenager but now wrong avoidable decisions can really change your life for the worse. Adulting isn’t easy but thats just the game we call life. Goodnight ya’ll I have to be up in about 4 hours to drive my rental 100 miles to go sell some windows.

65,How Do I Buy a Car?,"Hello my friends. I'm 24 years old and I currently drive a 2005 Toyota Matrix with 150k miles on it, that I bought used from my dad who had gotten it new. Recently I got a new job, started making better money, and I want to get a new car. 

My issue is, everything I see looks like its way overpriced! A guy I work with told me he bought his 2019 Veloster Turbo for 18k, brand new off the lot, because he talked the sales guy down. That seems absurd to me! 

I'm looking at a used 2015 Toyota Avalon w ~50k miles and the asking price is roughly 16k. That seems way too much, but how do I negotiate on the price? I've heard the best thing to do is get pre-approved for a loan from my bank before going to the dealer. How much would you offer on a 2015 car with 50k miles? How do I know what I should be looking for?

75,Power Steering gone out on my 2014 Ford Escape.. Help!,"Hi all. The other day, I get into my car and get a “Power Steering Assist Failure” on my dashboard. The messaged seemed to prove true as it seemed my assisted power steering had turned off or stopped working.

It’s still technically drivable, so I take it into my local trusted mechanic. Long story short, he says that there is no power steering pump, and that it’s all electrical. He says there was nothing I could have done to break this power steering electrical piece. The replacement is $2,600 (parts and labor).

So I call my local Ford dealership, and ask if my car is under warranty, or if there has been a recall on a defective piece. Turns out, they only warranty up to 12 months for this part, and there is no recall. They said they would need me to bring it into them to get a price quote to fix it.

So my questions for you guys are... has anyone ever experienced this with their Ford Escape? 

And, does this mean Ford is knowingly selling vehicles with defective parts, and expecting the consumer to assume the costs of repairs, even when there is nothing the driver could do to cause this malfunction? How does this work?

I started going back,until I heard a crrrr sound on the right of me. Turn around and I see my car just 5 or 10 cm away from the other car and the side mirrors crossed together. Fuck, I drove forward. The owner's mother came running forward and jumped on my car, opened the gate and... well, then I was there in the market with my door open, eyes teary, brother next to me getting angry, mother of owner shouting. We waited for the owner to come back, I apologized furiously. I was in college, had no money to compensate. They were kind enough to let me go although they did get angry. 

Now, I have lost confidence in my abilities. I came back home, told everything to my parents and decided that it was the end of my driving career. I have not touched the car in last 1 year. Even if I want to, I get the same flashbacks again and again, the same voice, tears...

It happens when I first press on the brakes each stop, if I press more on them it doesn't click again. But it does when I release them and press on the gas.

164,"How much should a decent, but not showroom quality paint job cost (single color, not changing color, engine bay, jams, etc.)?","My little corrado has been with me for 18 years at this point. I used to take extremely good care of the paint, but when I moved to a high elevation state, the paint just... died. The clearcoat fogged and started peeling and I never really had the money to get anything other than a rattlecan job. So I never did anything.

Now that I'm a bit older and finally have a bit of money, my first order of business is to essentially ""restore"" the car. So in the next few months I plan on stripping the car (interior and engine bay) and sending it off for bodywork and paint. (Yes, stripping it is necessary, much of the interior wiring has shorted somewhere and fuses blow for a lot of the interior things, so I plan on pretty much making a new harness.. and I figured if I'm going to do this, I may as well make the engine bay pretty as well. Nothing extravagant, just new paint and heat protection stickers on the hood and maybe some tidier routing for hoses and wires.)

Anyway, I have no idea how much a paint job should cost. Sure, you can get really cheap ones for what... a grand? But I want a paint job that will last for the remainder of this car's life (properly taken care of... of course.) The car is silver and I want it to be painted with the original paint code, so no color change. There is one or two minor dents... unfortunately one of them is on the back corner of the car, in a very difficult to repair spot. One is just a normal dent on the roof. The entire car needs prepped and painted. Nothing is salvageable. The rear bumper is also the wrong color (I got rear-ended, resulting in a ruined bumper and the aforementioned dent.) I plan on delivering the car to the shop on a flatbed, with literally everything I can strip off of the car stripped (within reason of course, it's gotta roll..). I don't know what options there are for getting a paint job, but I want the paint to essentially be as durable as OEM, but... better (cause OEM paint often has many imperfections.)

178,[UK] struggling to match up against Type R GT,"So I’m looking at my next car, I want a hot hatch that’s less than 30k. I wouldn’t buy brand new, so I’d be looking at anything 1year+ old. I personally just think buying new is retarded and the depreciation just isn’t worth the luxury of a brand new car. I mean come on what’s someone gonna do to a car in a year?

My options are:
type R (favourite)
2019 Focus ST
Golf R
Cupra R
Focus RS (already had one though)
Rs3
Hyundai i30N

I know the new civic shape is a love hate, but I honestly LOVE the car, it’s aggressive, bold and out there. For a 30k or less car it’s striking and stands out which is what I like. The design isn’t for everyone though. And it’s seriously quick. The only thing beating it on the nuburgring was the Megane RS which had a full performance kit and carbon aero which totals the car at upwards of 70 grand, so they are a league apart... 

The new focus ST looks pretty nice in orange but still very plain, and is my gripe for a lot of these cars. The cupra, golf R and the Audi are all just, very boring.  Probably why I’d never own a golf or Audi again.

The focus RS is an option, I had one in 2017 and what an amazing car it was. You can find this discontinued 2018 model that’s 1.5years old for the lower end of 20k. I love the exhaust, feels like a true rally exhaust and is something ford has always done great, although the new ST has the artificial pops it’s just not the same. I struggle to see any benefit of the new ST over the RS as both cars are about the same price as they turn a year old, and with better performance in the RS it seems a no brainer..

Maybe I’m being stuck up, but I’ve always known Hyundai to be a family car manufacturer. So I can’t get my head around the i30N. The car looks very small and delicate, not sure if it’s as aggressive as I’d like.",cars,1581212762,PeacewalkerGG,1,1,True,2020-02-08

188,Which cars have a door handle button that locks AND unlocks,"In other words, I'm looking for a car that doesn't just automatically unlock whenever a sensor detects you grabbing the door handle. I know the auto-unlock setup is much more common, and maybe there's some obvious reasoning I'm missing here. But I much prefer being able to exit the car, press the button to lock the doors, and then pull the handle as I'm walking away just to confirm that it's locked. And obviously that doesn't work if putting your hand on the handle automatically causes it to unlock.

I was going to write this long thesis about why I think the button setup is better, but for now, I just want some help finding out which cars have that feature.

I know Nissan is one such car, but that's the only one I've found so far. And interestingly enough, Nissan is also the only company I've found that puts the blind spot warning light on the corner panel inside the car (where the side mirror is attached). the way I see it, a warning light appearing on a black panel is much more visually striking than on a mirror where all kinds of lights (streetlights, storefronts, etc) are constantly appearing and disappearing as you drive. I know there's an audio warning too, and honestly I'd prefer having two warning lights, on on each location.

I finally got to the switch, but driving rain, ignorance and not wanting to destroy a part that did not seem to want to be freed by my fumbling, I just kept coolant as full as possible until I could afford to get to a shop. 

I've had to replace the radiator on a first gen Kia Rio. There's no repairing. It's a drop in part. Same with my civic. Why? I'm sure the basics involve cost, but why is this a thing?

219,"Meet the Vauxhall Lotus Carlton, an early 90s British Speed Demon of a Saloon","Well, guys, for my fellow American car nuts, I'd like you to meet an infamous icon for our counterparts across the Atlantic. This is the Vauxhall Lotus Carlton. The result of a partnership between Vauxhall and Lotus, it fostered one hell of a sedan, or as they say, sports saloon. Powered by a twin turbocharged inline six, this car is capable of getting up to 55 MPH in first gear alone, and can rocket to a top speed of above 177 MPH. Even by modern standards, that is freaking fast! 

The reason I say it is infamous, however, is that, during the short production life of this car, from 1990 to, I believe, 1992 or 93, any Brits in here correct me if I'm wrong, is that it became a favorite of robbers in England to steal. Why, you ask? Because this car, could actually OUTRUN the British police cars at the time. Police cars in England at the time could not hope to get to the Carlton's top speed, and so were left in the dust. One particularly famous stolen Lotus Carlton, actually managed to elude the police multiple times, becoming something of a infamous legend in the country. It led to some people actually calling for the car to be banned from being sold and driven on the streets for a time, I believe you can actually find the news reports on YouTube.

Either way, though, this is a car that is impressive in every conceivable way. That is why myself, I've been saving up to, hopefully soon enough, have one imported into the U.S. from the U.K., as it would be one heck of a car to have on our shores. Hope you enjoyed learning about it if you didn't know!

The doors are also iced shut with a thinner layer. Any advice on how to get the car running? 

My current plan is to clear the snow off, somehow get one of the doors open, clear the area around the exhaust pipe, then start it up and let it idle while I shovel it out. Let the heat melt the inside layer of ice until I can get under it and slide it off.

Hey guys,

I am completely new to this sub. Anyway, I have had this in my mind now for quite some time. I want to learn everything about how a car works. You know, the everything, like how Ken Miles from ""Ford V Ferrari"" understands how a car should be driven. I know this sounds insane but I want to try and match Mile's intuitive understanding in cars. I really want to know how my car works, I want to be able to feel it, I want to know why and how two cars can be different if say looking at acceleration, power of the engines, or if comparing whatever you can with cars!

After watching ""Ford V Ferrari"", my thirst became even stronger, was just so inspired by Ken Miles and Shelby.

But, I am not planning to take a course yet because I am a Uni student and I am currently studying full time. I was wondering if there is another way I could learn, a way that will make me learn in my own terms, like not rushing, taking my time, like learning it as a hobby, you know a past time. But I want to learn every serious, nitty gritty stuff about how a car works.

Well, I hope my intentions are clear and honestly saying, any advice would be awesome. Do you guys think there is a way for me? I highly appreciate your support, knowledge and time.

Edit: Oh and, how can one get into racing by the way? I am 20 if that helps, will be turning 21 soon. Like, racing as a hobby and maybe go even higher and actually race in competitions? Is that possible for someone like me with no racing experience? I am guessing there is a place to learn how to race? I am from Australia by the way if that helps. Thanks again guys.

Edit: I posted this on ""Automotivetraining"" but a redditor from there said to try this sub.

He’s selling it to me for a pretty low price in my budget range, every other car in my budget range have at least 100k miles on them. I’m not necessarily looking for turbo, or a race car, or even a stick shift but the way i see it the pros sort of outweigh the cons, let me know what you guys think?

361,1997 Ford Ranger 2.3l Idling Issue. Bad alternator?,"Hi r/cars,

I have a 1997 Ford Ranger 2.3l manual with 189k miles.

Recently when idling I've been getting a shudder, sometimes it's light sometimes it's pretty violent. This is accompanied by the dummy battery gauge showing a drop in voltage, also the headlights dim slightly. Sometimes the shuddering will last a split second, sometimes it will shudder until I hit the gas.

It hasn't died on me and I don't have any issues when driving, just idling.

I don't have a tachometer so I don't know if the idle is dropping also, but it sounds and feels like it is.

Also the issue is intermittent but it's been getting more frequent. It seems to be more frequent in warmer weather. Sub 40 degrees it's never done it.

Does this sound like the alternator is starting to go bad? Is there anything else I should troubleshoot before the alternator?

373,The perfect SUV/Family car,"I am not going to bore you with to many details, but provide a time line of the cars i had, what i test drove and how i ended up with my current car as the family car!

2014 - Leased a Jeep Grand Cherokee overland. Loved this car, the driving dynamics were amazing, and had the air-suspension that just made the experience that much better. Other features it had, that at that time didn't think much of, air conditioned seats.

2017- lease came due and after further discussing the next car with my wife, we decided to get another jeep. BUTTTT lol and a big but, i listed to my wife to go with a cheaper version, Jeep grand Cherokee Altitude. After driving off the lot, I automatically regretted the no air suspension and 3 months later when summer hit, I missed my air conditioned seats.

Lease of the altitude was coming due in January 2020, and a lot has changed since 2017, my wife and i had twin girls and therefore felt we needed a bigger car.

the search started in November 2019 and here are the cars i test drove with comments: budget $70K

LandRover Discovery - Felt very nose heavy and not as luxurious inside. One major flaw was the rear seats ( not the third row), they are so low, that anyone over the height of 5'4 will have their knees to their chest.

Kia Telluride- Spacious, buttons on the dash didn't feel luxurious at all, and the major draw back was the following. When i drive long distance i like to rest my left arm on the doors sill or armrest whatever you want to call it, it was so thin and far away that you couldn't rest it. that annoyed me and said no. also felt under powered and one major item missing - lumber support of the passenger!

Subaru Accent - great car but felt under-powered, and once again, when you drive long distance and try to rest your right arm on the arm rest, its slated downward and the shift knob is short and you cant rest your wrist on it. So that was a no for me. i know i sound i am picking at little things, but if you drive more than an hour, those little things become big. Also no lumber support of the passenger

Bmw x5 - Having owned a bmw before, i was expecting the new generation to be more refined in sense of driving dynamics, i was super disappointed, drove like a Japanese suv. which is not a bad thing, but bad for a German car.

Mercedes GLE - felt okay, just not special enough for the price tag. Unless you are going for 580 engine with 500HP, the lower ends are not worth it and I wasn't ready to pay 100K

Audi q7- felt the best out of all the cars, but had one short coming, the one that you really want to drive off the lot, cost 90K and they dont lease well.

Honda Passport - amazing car, no faults BUTTTT no lumber support for the passenger. I keep saying this, but wife had back surgery and she needs to be able to adjust the lumber support.

So i ended up with another Jeep Grand Cherokee "" high altitude"" . reason for this was, it has all the features of the overland, plus all the new safety features, adaptive cruise control, self parking, blind spot motoring, front collision warning etc... and the list goes on and on. Also i decided this time around to go with the HEMI v8 - which i now have zero regret when comparing this car with the Germans. I wish it had a little more trunk space, but we made it work.

Leases prices i was quoted for each car: based on 12k a year miles

Land rover Discovery: $6500 out of pocket - $791 a month - Fully loaded

Kia Telluride- $3200 out of pocket - $590 a month - Fully loaded

Subaru Accent- $2900 out of pocket- $500 a month - Fully loaded

BMW x5 - $4900 out of pocket - $790 a month - MSRP $72K not fully loaded some options

Benz GLE $5500 out of pocket - $820 a month MSRP- $73K not fully loaded some options

Audi q7- $6200 out of pocket - $900 a month MSRP $78K almost fully loaded just not the big engine

Honda Passport $3000 out of pocket - $490 a month - MSRP $44k fully loaded

Jeep Grand cherokee "" High Altitude"" $539 a month - Msrp $60K - Fully loaded Hemi v8

402,Im done with ford,"This is gonna be a bit of a rant, but here it goes. 

Long story short, I recently sold my 2004 toyota 4runner limited v8, after my grandmother gave me her 2004 ford f150 lariat. I was given the truck for 1 dollar and thought it was worth the time and effort. It had 150k miles on it, but i was told it was well maintained and properly cared for. I knew it was on its 3rd engine, ( its a 5.4 3v, a terrible engine) and second transmission. These had both been replaced about 10,000 miles ago and were said to be ready to go. I also was told everything was in good shape and i was ready to go. After 2 weeks of driving, my brakes were kinda wonky, so i brought it to my local mechanic, and thats when i got the news. My perfectly maintained truck needed about 8k worth of work. I neede all new brakes, rotors, calipers. The water pump was leaking, the radiator was leaking, both front ball joints are bad, the oil filter housing was cracked, the pan meeded to be reseated, the fuel system was leaking and the rear differential needed to be replaced. I know some of this is just normal wear, but most of these things are things that should not have failed, and yet they did. My toyota was at 200k and it never once had an issue even simmilar to this.

But this isnt the only reason ive lost my faith in ford. 
My dad bought a 2017 ford f-150 platinum with the ecoboost 3.5 new from ford. In 2 years we have had 14 recalls on our truck. But it gets worse. About 20k miles into ownership, our engine developed what we thought to be a lifter tick. Brought it back to ford under warranty, and they identified it as the cam phasers, ans the engine would need to be rebuilt. This took close to a month. Then, about 1,000 miles later all of the electronics failed. No screens, no cameras, nothing. We lost a control module, ford replaced under warranty. Then this past week, the cameras died again, and the engine is ticking again at just under 40k miles. 


But heres why im truly done.

Ford may produce the best selling vehicle in America, but how can a company that doesnt know why its losing money, whos stocks have dove so far that they are almost worth nothing, manage to make it work. I keep trying with ford, but i keep being let down. Im a huge fan of the original broncos, but i officially have lost all hope for the return. Even if they get the bronco right, its still a ford. Something that i just have no faith in. 

Sure, maybe they can change, but until i see drastic improvements in their corporate structure, better vehicle launches amd improved build quality and reliability, I have to take my business elsewhere.

TLDR; all my fords have let me down somehow, and i dont see enough improvement in ford to keep with them.",cars,1581311094,fossnic,56,1,True,2020-02-10

If you got this far, you know my new truck isn’t very new by any means. She’s a 1983 Chevrolet C20, complete with a 5.7L V8 350ci powerhouse under the hood.

However, the truck really isn’t getting the punch that I know a 4 barrel carburetor should offer me with a 350ci under the hood. After a little bit of discussion with my pops (who owned 4 of this style, but with 305s) informed me that the reason I wasn’t getting the punch I was expecting was because it wasn’t dropping into the bigger butterfly, and thus, I was hearing the engine rev and roar, but I wasn’t getting the full performance of the carb.

438,I hate EVs because they are Pay For Range,"Until today, we had classes of cars divided mainly by power of the motor itself, and the price range was according to that. Cheap cars, small motor, very slow going uphill, you are poor, you cant have fun uphill, fine... But you can drive same distance with rich guys at the same time, because you can fuel the car in a very short period of time.

With EVs we will be forced to buy almost twice more expensive cars, which will impact mostly the lower income class (east EU), than rich guys like most of you (west EU, americans). There will be no possibility to buy new cars at 9,000$ as today (Dacia, cheap Peugeots, VW Up, Skoda citigo, Hyundai i10), but you have to buy the same chasis but EV which starts at 20,000$. Double the price.

Iam coming from Czechia (west neighbour of Germany), people are mostly buying Skoda's (basically VW little cheaper brother for 90% of the VW price). Average car there is 16 years old. Most of the cars are bought by companies (management) and after 3-5 years companies are selling them to their employees, other main source of cars is import of used cars from Germany (5-10yo) cars and drive them next 10 years. Not many people are buying their own new cars. Poor people here are buying used cars under 4,000$ like a bread. When offer like this appears on the internet, its bought immediately.

Iam wondering what will be people buying as EVs. If you driven whole life combis (wagons are really popular here) and you expect price level 20,000$ for new car (lower middleclass standard) and suddenly only possibility is to buy some small city EV microcar, you will be mad and dissapointed. If you were buying only cheap cars, you will be priced off the market totally...

If you are not buying new, but used, can you imagine the cost of exchange of the batteries? People are used to buy 4000$ car, repair something for 1000$ (brakes, suspension, motor) and drive it next 2 years without any money on maintenance. Now imagine having to pay 6 000$ for a battery swap of used Tesla. Its worth more than car...

**And the most important thing.** Range. In EV, you dont pay mainly for the motor size, but for the range. Do you remember that EV jokes before Tesla? Renault Zoe with 22kWh battery and shitty efficiency? Thats what we have on used market and its 50% more expensive than todays new petrol car.

When you want to go somewhere, you have to charge it on quickchargers which offers electricity 4x more expensive than your home electricity. This was new for me, suddenly all charging companies are rising prices here... You have no choice, you dont have Tesla with 370mi range, you have only like 60miles range and you have to stop every 60 miles (1hour of driving) to charge it for 1 hour. Can you imagine going even 200 miles with this type of cheap car?

Tell me, what can we expect in next 5-10 years of EV cars? Is there any cheap car coming with sufficient range or everything is Pay For Range?

Iam affraid, that this EV shift is too fast and will price out many people from driving...",cars,1581339103,7bitcoin,9,1,True,2020-02-10

454,Is this car right for me?,"I'm a college student that's been wanting a ""dream car"" for several years now. I've been driving a 2005 Corolla that's barely at 300k miles and started running into problems that cost more than the car itself. Now that I'm doing well financially, I'm looking to buy off a car completely (if it's $20k or less) around or lease it if it's a bit pricier. For those of you telling me to wait longer to get a car, I've got the financing covered and won't go even near bankrupt after my purchase.

For the past few years, I've been hopping back and forth between the more popular sports cars: and didn't know what to go for: Mustang, Camaro, Challenger, G35/37, BRZ/86/FRS, C5 Corvette, etc.

Here are some of the things I've been looking for in my first dream car:

* I wanted a sporty car where I can daily drive in both the suburban and city areas so decided to go for an automatic. MPG doesn't really matter to me as long as it's not 10 MPG.
* Since I'm looking for a daily driver, I'm going to go really easy on my car. I'm still going to be having fun and may play around with only minor aesthetics (badges, rims, taillights, etc.) and maybe a muffler delete or any axleback/catback exhaust system.
* I would prefer a four-seater even if it means cramming shorter people back there.
* Reliability is a must for me, as I've been driving one of the most reliable cars on the market, I'm looking for something in the same category. I'm able to do minor maintenance to my car such as: oil changes, brake changes, spark plug changes, etc. I want to keep my car as low-maintenance as possible and drive for more than a few years.

&amp;#x200B;

Although the BRZ looks promising, the horsepower disappoints me, and I want to drive something other than something that I've been driving for a while, the 4-cylinder engine of a Corolla. Not saying the Boxer engine is disappointing, I just want something with a bit more power (maybe something around 330 NA HP).

Out of all my options, the Hyundai Genesis Coupe looked the most promising. The 3.8 has 348 naturally aspirated horsepower, the car pops on stock, automatic comes with paddle shifter, and there's a lot of them on the market around my area that are 70k miles or less. Some of them may come with the Brembo's and the 100k 10-year warranty from Hyundai which may be a plus.  


Though, I heard there are quite a few issues: the front lip scratching off, taillights building condensation, heat shield rattles, passenger windows not being sealed properly, handling being poor and 'disappointing' compared to competitors, etc.

I'm going to test drive the Genesis Coupe soon, but I want to hear you guys tell me if there's a better car for me. If there are any of you Genny owners out there I would like to hear from you too!

This wasn't the average rumble of the engine, but rather like a vibrating or shaking. It seemed that once I went above a certain speed the rumbling/vibrating would become more intense. It subsided after I decreased my speed below 60mph. I'm wondering what it could be so I opened my hood once I got to work and found that the piece of insulating weather stripping inside the hood was loose. I took it out and threw it in the trunk but I'm thinking that the piece of rubber being loose wouldn't have caused that much vibration.

I thought it might be a battery issue because eventually the radio and lights came back on but it still would not start. Jumpstarting it didn't seem to work unless I did it wrong.

Then I thought it was an anti-theft issue so I reset that (which took awhile) but that didn't help.

4,I finally got to meet a Porsche 911,"Today I had the opportunity to ""meet"" what I would consider to be one of my favorite cars, the Porsche 911. I say ""meet"" because while I did get to see it, check it out inside and out, and even drive it about 15 feet, I wouldn't go as far to say that I got to experience it fully. That being said, here's the story.

This morning I arrived at my job, pour myself a cup of coffee, and start to dig into my work. Normally I have a few minutes to chat with coworkers and see what everyone else has lined up for their day, but today I arrived a half hour late, so I'm basically head down and in the zone. Around midday our mechanic comes up to me asking if I can help him out with shuffling some cars around the shop so he can make room for another. Anything to get up from my desk. I go over, move a couple cars, and open the garage door so we can pull in this other car. Then I see it. The other car was a 993 Porsche 911. 

Now I know to some people this isn't such a big deal, but to me this is my first proper encounter with a 911, let alone an air cooled one, and I simply cant stop smiling. I've always found cars cool and had my share of hot wheels like every other kid, but my actual enthusiasm for them didn't develop until about 7 years ago when I got my first car. With that, I found my true passion. Over the years Ive managed to drive a Ferrari California, a super clean E46 M3, an STI Modded to the gills, and plenty of other fun cars that we all know and love, but the 911 had escaped me until today. Outside of the New York International Auto Show (where you cant touch them), I haven't even been able to get up close to one. I even took a trip to Munich last year, and just seeing them parked all over the place was enough to make me drool. To me, they are some of the most beautiful cars ever created (even the 996, sorry not sorry). Me and the mechanic have been working together and talking cars for years, so he knows how much I've always appreciated Porsche, and asks me to bring it into the garage for him. He hands me the keys, and with all the self-control I could muster (this is a customers car after all), casually walked over to the car. That's when the experience began.

I reached for the door handle and realized it doesn't pull out like a normal one would. I look closer and see the little lever behind the handle. I pull the lever and I hear that satisfying \*pop\* of the door latch. The hairs on my neck stand up. I haven't even gotten into the car yet and I'm already in love. This feels special. Hell, it even sounds special. I get in, and everything is super clean. Its a '95 non-turbo with only around 10k miles on it, and it has been well taken care of over the last quarter century. I move the seat back a little and then realize just how close the pedals are to each other. I take a look at my size 12 shoes sitting in the slightly cramped foot well, but decide that this can work. Once I close the door (and hear that wonderful latch again), that's when the smell hits me. A nostalgic, but brand new smell at the same time. It had that classic 90's car smell that we all know, but just better. I cant explain how, it just smelled better. I look around the interior, take it all in, and get started. Key in, clutch down, key turned, and then I hear it. The sound of its boxer engine starting up right behind me was pure euphoria. I've never been in a rear engine car before while it was running, and I never considered how different the audio experience would be. After about a minute of sitting there, I press the clutch, put it into gear, and pull it into the garage. The clutch felt smooth and precise, and the shifter tight and direct, a joy to drive even if just for a second. Once in the garage, I put it in neutral, engaged the parking brake, shut her down, and just sat there for a few minutes taking it all in. Then it was over. Back to work, where I spent the rest of my shift window shopping, still smiling like an idiot.

No, I didn't get to take it out for a spirited drive through mountain roads. I didn't even rev the engine to really hear it in all of its glory. I maybe drove it 15 feet, and at a crawling pace at that, but the impression it left is something that will last a lifetime. I got to meet a hero of mine, shake its hand, and realize in my short interaction that not only is it everything that I had imagined, but so much more.",cars,1578527208,CRR10,5,1,True,2020-01-08

Then my son who has a 1 year old Forester said that the oil burning light came on quite frequently recently. He had the oil changed every time it came on. So he's having the oil change every 5,000 miles. That's quite an expense for synthetic oil service.

18,"The 9FF GT9, the craziest semi-Porsche ever","I call this thing a semi-Porsche, because it's basically not at all a 911 anymore. Anyway, what's faster than a Bugatti Veyron, has RWD , and has an optional manual transmission? This thing does!

The 9FF GT9 is very loosely based off the 911, but is still called a 911 for some goddamn reason. It's not even rear-engined, it's mid engine. The engine is a bored-out 4.0 liter twin turbo flat six based of a Porsche engine, but in the base model, it makes *987 horsepower,* the same as a Bugatti Veyron did back in 2007 when this came out, linked to either a six-speed sequential, or a six speed manual, something Bugatti couldn't offer.                                                                                                               
However, because it was mainly a Porsche powertrain in a carbon bodyshell with a tube frame, it only weighed 2,923 pounds, a good 1200 less than the Bugatti. This naturally led to some fast performance. The base GT9 would do 254 mph, tying the Veyron, but that apparently wasn't fast enough for 9FF, who later released the GT9-R, a car now with fucking ***1,120 horsepower***. Keep in mind, again, this car had a optional SIX-SPEED MANUAL and weighed 2,923 pounds, making in this basically the ultimate drivers' car with way too much power. Top speed on the GT9 was 257.2 mph, faster than even the SSC Ultimate Aero and 0-60 was in 2.9 seconds (though it isn't known whether or not this was with a manual), 0-186 mph  in 15.8 seconds.

From my point of view, as someone that enjoys driving, a good car is one that is enjoyable to drive. This includes various factors, but the handling of a car is important to me. My personal car has a 1.5 Turbo engine, and it has very respectable performance due to being lightweight and producing a reasonable amount of hp.

A Mazda MX-5, for example, is similar to mine. It has relatively low power, but is also lightweight and handles like a dream. It is now very much loved my car enthusiasts because it is so much fun to drive.

I often see comments/posts on reddit which criticize peoples cars because of the engine size. It's often done by those that have cars with huge engines, yet their vehicle doesn't perform much better than mine or a MX-5. Not to mention, handling-wise, they wouldn't stand a chance against a lightweight car through corners. I'm interested to hear your thoughts on this.

I put MBRP axle backs on which is essentially a muffler delete. The car sounded great with that setup besides the rattle. A replacement suitcase resonator from Ford was almost $500 so I decided to be cheap and have two 12 inch bottle style resonators welded in it's place.

The car sounded like absolute shit. Horrible sound and the volume was unbearable. At 1,800 rpm it sounded like my rear window was going to shatter. Some of the interior panels could be seen vibrating, let alone the noise that made in the cabin. Normal acceleration under 2500 rpms was louder than my old mid muffler deleted Scat Pack at full throttle. 

Went out and bought a Borla muffler/resonator and had it welded in this morning. It is actually quieter than with the stock resonator but deeper and produces a better sound. I'm out $100 by trying to cheap out but..lesson learned I guess.

103,The story of how Honda’s Jet division helped their F1 engineers with a power unit issue,"All credit goes to /r/formula1/comments/elpzxs/_/fdjvnlt/?context=1

https://f1-gate.com/honda/f1_54357.html

""The atmosphere was that if we could use our technology in the world of F1, we ​​had never been involved in, we would be glad to do it. In general, everyone was flipping forward.""

The structure of the aircraft turbofan jet engine was similar to that of the MGU-H.

Naomi Strawashi says that when she first saw the MGU-H, she quickly found the cause of the trouble.

""When I saw the long shaft, the turbines on both sides, and the place to support the bearings, I felt honestly,"" Is this really going around? "", Says Naomi Strawashi.

""The biggest cause was the bearings that supported the shaft. The aircraft division changed the position and number of bearings and adjusted the installation method at each location. In addition, improvements were made such as changing the thickness of the shaft depending on the location. This enabled the shaft to rotate stably.

Yasuaki Asaki says, ""I was skeptical whether it would be fixed as soon as I asked the jet.""

""It was incredible to fix it in one shot. I was surprised. Even though my company, I thought that it was amazing that our company had great technical skills.""

Other snippets of info from the documentary by F1motta at F1technical:

During the weekend I was able to watch NHK documentary about Honda's first win in hybrid era. It's almost two hours long and there is a lot of great stories...

Honda is conducting its own research on fuel and ExxonMobil only produces it,

Before Austrian GP Honda specialists have suggested Red Bull engineers to change the configuration of the front suspension - to improve airflow in the sidepods (they saw some problems during French GP - hot race). That’s why Max could use (first time during the season) “engine 11 mode 5” and win the race (top level Honda’s figure gave the race team permission to take that risk) - Mercedes &amp; Ferrari both suffered from engine overheating,

HondaJet engineers did an amazing job to save Honda’s racing program. Before 2018 they found a way to stabilize the shaft connecting the turbine with the compressor - it was Honda’s main problem (during McLaren era) after they changed the size of turbine and compressor (in SizeZero concept MGU-H system was just too small and couldn’t generate as much energy as other PUs). HondaJet engineers were able to solve this problem in the first attempt. The funny thing is no one in the group believed that HondaJet could have any impact on the project.

In 2018 HondaJet engineers designed new shape of blades for turbine and compressor - the target was to keep the power level and generate more energy by MGU-H even in lower flow conditions. This changes were introduced in 2019 engine and it was a good step forward,

2018 Honda &amp; Red Bull (via. Toro Rosso) used to build mutual trust and develop communication methods - Franz Tost did an amazing job there,

In 2019 both Red Bull and Toro Rosso car were designed around Honda engine and with Honda’s engineers input,

Honda has invested a lot of money in buying new production tools - aluminium engine parts are no longer made by casting. Now they use advanced machine tools,

He called himself ""the wraith"" and his team was a small group of 4 people. He always drove a Blue1996 NSX. He was a mysterious guy who never spoke and never took off his blacked-out helmet. But damn he could drive. I've never seen anyone professional or otherwise drive like him. He could make entire cars disappear. He was fast and scary. But he never let anyone see his face. I tried racing him a few times and lost miserably. And every time I did he came up to me and shook my hand. He always congratulated everyone and made sure to keep the community together.

The community was a group of people who were just trying to have a good time. I went because driving helped me get over my addictions. And I wasn't the only one. But the community had a strong sense of support. All of us were here to compete but we also had each others back. I'll never forget my time there. Because in a way the community is where my life started. I kicked my addictions and even met the love of my life. I met some of the best people and got to make a few bucks doing it. 

After a while, the stakes got higher and the community got larger. But even when we had over 100 members he never lost. After 2 years of meeting up every Thursday, he just disappeared. He left the way he came. Without saying anything to anyone. And it was like when he left so did the heart of the community. Because 1 month later the racing community disbanded.

218,Pontiac Aztek 2001 with 'Hot Coolant Temp' Red Light - What's an Acceptable Amount to Pay for Repair?,"Hi, friends.

About two years ago I bought a 2001 Pontiac Aztek from an eBay auction - paid $1350 and have had NO problems with it for the past two years (it only had 70k miles BUT had been in a wreck [minor body damage to bumper], was wrapped in a company's logo sticker and had been sitting in a garage forever).

The oil pan is cracked, and I've been dealing with that because I was quoted something dumb as fuck to fix that, but now all of a sudden the 'Hot Coolant Temp' red light is coming on, and I can only drive it for a few miles before I start smelling the burning and the engine starts making clicking sounds like it's going to f'ing kill me. 

I started riding my bike instead because I couldn't afford to fix the car, and also I'm a little portly so it works out, but now after calling me stupid for two days, my mother has decided she'll pay to fix it. 

I did some research about what could be the issue, and seems it's either water pump or fan belt or my blatant stupidity for not knowing how car works. 

She has also offered to buy me another car in a $4k price range, but I don't know if that's better since that car might eventually have problems, too, so do I just fix what I already have? 

And I am girl and don't want to get assfucked at Pep Boys, so **What would you do?**

For clarity's sake, the Taurus is my friends car, not mine.

So I got the alternator replaced on this car successfully and the car was able to start from a jump no problem. When we disconnected the jumper cables though, the lights started to flicker unless we put the cables back on. After jumping it for a while and letting it run for a while, it was fine, until we cut it off and tried to start it again. It wouldn't start and just started making loud clicking sounds.

So here's my main question: This is the battery being dead now, right? From what I remember, a dead alternator is gonna be hell on a battery, and can kill a new battery in no time flat. So the problem is that the battery isn't holding a charge anymore because of the degradation, right?

This is the ""Horsepower Heros"" competition which is basically a dyno comp, its run at the annual Summernats in Canberra, Australia. This particular car is built and owned by the owner of a shop called Dyno-Mite Performance in Victoria, Australia.

The setup on this car is a destroked Ford Barra, standard capacity on these engines is 4.0lt, this one is a 3.7lt combo, 110mm turbo, custom cams and runs methanol. They haven't disclosed too many details about it so I don't know for sure but I'd expect that it's a grout filled block and it would definitely have some kind of beefy main cap girdle. There's probably not much else to do in the block as its a factory iron block so is pretty strong to begin with, block cracking is not a thing on Barras except at extreme power levels. I'm going to assume they aren't running standard size head studs as this car probably sees 50-60psi of boost (just a guess), I'd expect the block has been drilled and tapped for oversize studs.

I've not heard of any other higher power Barras, there are several in the 1500-1800whp range but this is definitely the biggest.

To put those numbers in perspective this car is making:

* 595.13 Horsepower per litre (assuming its exactly 3.7lt)
* 9.75 Horsepower per cubic inch (assuming 3700cc which its probably not but roughly 225ci)
* 1292.25 per ton (metric ton, 1000kg)
* Power to weight ratio of 1.22:1 (assuming a weight of 1800kg, stock weight is 1704kg)

Seems obvious - don't let the turbo run. Easy advice to take when cruising on the highway. But let's say you just turned on the highway. Do you accelerate slow over a long period to avoid the turbo coming on? Or do you accelerate rapidly and get to highway speed fast, at which point you cruise?

You learn how cars handle at the limit and then traction control steps in and cuts power while pulling into traffic because you had a tiny bit of wheelspin, or stability control steps in and fucks up a slide you had complete control of, almost making you wreck.

308,"Have an extended car warranty that doesn’t cover an expensive repair, how can I get this repair done cheaper?","SO the details:

Bought a used 2010 BMW x3 x30i from a new car dealership (Vancouver BC) in October 2019, had 109K km on it. It's now at 114, 800 for what I thought was a good deal(turns out it was not). The final price was $12,800 after tax. No known issues at the time It has a 6month or 5000km on a Lubrico limited powertrain warranty (still valid). 

I took it in for service and turns out it leaks, and this is a known issue I found out after I bought it. Fairly big repair job, valve cover ($625), oil filter housing gasket ($53.50) and gasket ($83.1) and labour ($1239) Plus tax brings me to ($3114.30). A big chunk of change! The claim from lubrico has already been rejected because it doesn’t cover seals and gaskets 

SO I don’t want to pay this repair since this is a relatively new purchase. 

So I got questions for all you insurance, warranty and car redditers out there.

· Is there any way I can upgrade the warranty? 

· Should I look to another warranty provider? If so plz recommend

· If I do get another warranty do I have to wait a certain period before I can make a claim?

· Should I just get rid of the car? 

o  I could trade it in for something that is less expensive to fix.

The leak is relatively minor and for now a non-critical repair, but it will be an issue going forward but I didn't really think as to how much BMWs cost to maintain a year (avg $1100) and I’m not super keen on shelling out of my pocket when it’s a new car (to me anyway).

What say you reddit? Is there a way for me to get this repair cheaper? 

I think my mechanic is legit, and he usually gives a good price, (and still has 5 stars after 55 reviews). Should I go back to the dealership and complain?",cars,1578689505,gratomsramblings,1,1,True,2020-01-10

360,The story of how JiffyLube scammed me and my father,"*please excuse my car-related ignorance, as this was 6 months ago. I'd like to think I know more about cars and how they work now*

Backstory (you can skip):

6 months ago, new circumstances in my life dictated that I needed a car and I asked my dad if I could drive his old Accord now that he doesn't need it. Keep in mind, for the last 3 years, the car had rarely been driven apart from short-distance grocery trips (maybe 5 miles a month). 

So we get an oil change, filter replacement, tire rotation, an AC refresh, etc. to make it roadworthy. But there's one problem: the car has an oil leak. After it's been driven it'll leave a 1-3in. oil spot on the street in front of our house which sucks because (1) environmental damage and (2) we have a very strict HOA. 

Actual Story:

We take it to a local mechanic and he quotes us $2.5k to fix an oil leak. $2.5k is essentially the car's value, so he tells us to just drive it regardless and fill up the oil when necessary.  

My dad, wanting to avoid HOA fines, decided the smartest thing to do would be to go to JiffyLube instead. They do our oil changes, so surely they can fix an oil leak? Truthfully, he was looking for a lower quote, but we would soon learn that it wouldn't be worth it. 

The JiffyLube mechanic notices sludge coming out of the distributor cap and tells us the distributor would have to be replaced. $445. He assures us that it'll fix the oil leak for good. Definitely a hit to the pocket, but smaller than a potential HOA fine. The distributor is replaced and we're on our way.

I take the car for a drive on the PCH later that evening to make sure everything is fine. 45 minutes pass, and all of a sudden, the engine misfires. I slow down a bit, another misfire. Keep driving, another misfire. The CEL came on and I had to limp the car back home almost 20 miles.

The next day, I take it to JiffyLube and they give me some bullshit about how the distributor timing was off. That's okay, we all make mistakes. They cleared the CEL (originally telling it us it was for a misfire), we were on our way, until it misfired again later that night. 

Now this story goes on and on. In total, we went back to the JiffyLube **5** times. Every time, they gave us more and more bullshit about the timing being off, a wire being loose, etc. Before going for the fifth time, my dad went to the original mechanic who quoted us for the oil leak fix. He read the CEL after kindly telling us we should never go to JiffyLube again.

All this time, it wasn't just a code for a misfire, but also a code for a failing crankshaft position sensor. Keep this in mind, as this is important. We take it to JiffyLube and tell them what the code is. The original mechanic who replaced the distributor now tells my dad that the CPMS was failing (and that it was located in the timing belt cover which was leaking, so the oil was dripping on the CPMS causing the fault), so it would be a very expensive fix (multiple thousand). Again, keep this in mind.

Since then, the car has been essentially dead. The oil leak wasn't fixed and we drive it every 1-2 weeks around the community to keep the battery charged. I've been saving to get this ""multi-thousand"" repair when today I ran up on a comment on the 6th generation Accord forum.

**The CPMS is located in the distributor.** This means that the mechanic lied to us multiple times. He gave us a faulty part, lied about fixing oil leak, lied about the CEL multiple times, then proceeded to give us an outrageous quote to stop us from coming back. I'd like to think he was just ignorant, but the irony is he ALSO drove a 6th gen accord, so he had to know.

I have a part and labor warranty on the distributor for 3 years. Is it worth going back to the JL? I don't know if I'll be able to resist calling the mechanic out.
I've learned a lot of things from this. (1) Fix it at home. (2) Find an honest mechanic. (3) Never, ever go to JiffyLube. My future oil changes will be done at Valvoline.",cars,1578718056,UnsolicitedPeanutMan,2,1,True,2020-01-10

When I first watched E.T as a kid in the 90s and saw the Audi 5000 that Dee Wallace drove in it, I fell absolutely in love with it. Personally, I even still now think of it as one of the most beautiful cars made in the last forty years. I've included a photo of the film car for reference here. And I've longed to own one  since my 6th birthday. Exactly the same as the one in the movie, same year, same color, etc. But, ever since I reached driving age in the mid 2000s, I've searched on car sale websites online country wide. In that entire time, I have never come across one for sale. Not in the U.S, not in Europe. It's been a ghost. So, what I'd like to know is, is it particularly hard to find a U.S. spec one still on the roads here in the States? Am I going to have to scour junkyards and basically bring one back to life to fulfill this dream of mine? And if I can find one, does anybody know what a fair price for one would be?

So today after a bit of rain, I was traveling to a near by place when I noticed some sand that had flown in along with the water, my brain was so slow to process this, and didn't think of slowing down thinking it would be just sand and therefore wouldn't be much of a problem, I went over the bump at Least 40 kph and the car was jumping all over the place for those fractions of second some things went TEEET TEET TEET and I pulled over at the side of the road and to inspect any damages done to the chassis or to the underneath the car in general but there wasn't any sign of mishap, but now the only problem is feel is the front suspension moves a little to much after going over a bump at normal speed. 

The ""sand"" were actually a heap of junk including plastic bottles, rocks, shredded tyres and other road side debree.

444,Anyone with experience successfully arguing for diminished value claim?,"In California, just bought a brand new 2019 Civic Type R. 140 miles on the odometer and some kid in a Camry backs into it while it's parked in a parking lot.

445,Is that illegal to hit a deer and ran off ?,"Hi, Im a foreigner student living in Canada.

I has been driving for 4 months, and earlier today I drove back home from a trip. It was dark and i was turn of my headlight since it an incoming vehicle. The moment i turn the headlight on again I saw a deer on my right and it just ran in front of the car, I did brake but not enough to stop the hit. ( I were at \~100km/h ) Then I hit the deer and it just fall off the road and laying down right there. I pulled to the side for a second and keep driving

I felt so sorry for what I have done, the image of the deer just appeared in my mind the whole time. I was cried on the way back home, I not often cry.

But when I got home, things are more serious and complicated than I thought.

My car’s front was extensively injured, then I started come to the internet to read about deer hitting. And I realized that I should have been pull over and turn the hazards on to notice the following vehicle and call the police as well.

I didnt do any of that, I dont even pull over and come out to check the car because I cant imagine it such a big deal. I honestly never thought of any of that because i never meet this situation.

What am I supposed to do ? I feel so bad, I have never did such a stupid/bad thing in my life, I always tried to do the right thing. But everything happened today, It were totally above my experience. Im shaking and panic.

459,The MK8 Golf uses cheaper and more plastic materials throughout the interior. Pictures included...,"https://imgur.com/a/ZCfaviD

In the comparison pictures, the door arm rest is much smaller, there is less felt in the door pocket, and less soft touch of the top piece of the door. IMO this is a sign of bad company leadership. Good company leadership wouldn't focus on blatant corner cutting to increase profits, instead it would focus on increasing sales by creating desirable products. But hey, most people won't notice, so it won't matter right?

VW is being lead by Herbert Diess who earned the reputation as a ""Kostenkiller""(cost killer) at BMW during the early 2000s. And we all know early 2000s BMWs are some of the most unreliable cars in existence. For reference, my dad had both, a new 2003 X5 and a new 2006 7 series years ago. Both had mechanical and electrical issues not long after purchase.

There is a trope on this subreddit that German cars are unreliable because of complexity. While this is true to some extent, clearly in the case of BMW many mechanical parts were designed to be disposable(aka water pump). 

In comparison, my family has own/owns 2 S classes and a GL450. None of them ever had one single issue. 

A company should not focus on blatant cost cutting such that the product won't ""last"" or such that the ""newer"" product has a worse quality interior than its predecessors. 

I never thought I would say this, but if you care about interior/material quality then do not buy the MK8 Golf. Go buy the brand new 2020 Corolla(for the europeans in the market for a hatch).

Well, in mid October or so, I got the water pump replaced. Before taking it in and doing that, I changed my thermostat myself. I have a new coolant resevoir, a new water pump, and a new thermostat all within the last 2 and a half/3 months.

My car has been running fine since the water pump replacement. My car doesn't chug, it doesn't eat gas, it doesn't feel slow. The performance seems to be there. I have heat, everything.

Drove to work today and noticed fluctuation in the temp. It moved up a little bit and I blasted the heat and it stabilized, then when I went to park at work it moved up a little again. On the way home, same thing. It stayed in the middle most of the way and started to rise when I got near home. I'll add that work is about 20 minutes away and I live in Washington state, so it's pretty cool outside.

Also, there is information on used cars to see if they hold up over the years where as with new cars, especially all-new models, you're basically the guinea pig testing out the product and hopefully nothing goes wrong.

131,Cybertruck vs Ford discussion and explanation.,"Let me preface this post by saying two things. First, I do not believe in brand loyalty, and in fact I find it to be very detrimental to the passionate pursuit and innovation of vehicles. Second, I do not hate the Cybertruck, nor do I think it's fair to call it bad/awful/claim it shouldn't exist.

I know there are threads about the Cybertruck already, and we're all well aware of the hate and/or love flame wars around. The rants, the praise. This isn't that, nor is it intended to be. This situation is unique in the fact that a lot of ""new"" people (I.E. people who may not know much about cars, or more specifically trucks) are taking part in the discussions surrounding it. This is due to overlapping interests, as the Cybertruck represents innovation not just for trucks, but for electric powered vehicles as a whole. It has attracted people from all parts both within, and outside of the car community. This thread is to hopefully explain some things to people who may not understand the matter entirely, and to share my thoughts with those who do. It is also to focus less on the Cybertruck as a whole, and more on the specific ""tow-off"" between it and the Ford F150. We'll start with facts, and after I will give my opinions. TL;DR at the end.

Lets start by defining tow capacity and how it works. Tow capacity is the amount of weight, as determined by the manufacturer, that a vehicle is reasonably expected to be able to tow. This is not the same as gross vehicle weight. It is solely the amount of weight you can tow via bumper hitch or fifth wheel hitch (the hitch that goes in the bed), and still stop safely with. It is also not an absolute. It is very possible for vehicles to both fall short of or exceed this rating, as it is solely determined by the manufacturer (for the sake of this discussion, we'll leave the DOT/DMV side of this matter out of it). Having a higher or lower tow rating doesn't inherently mean a vehicle is better or worse, nor does it mean it has more or less power. In summation, if a manufacturer gives a vehicle a tow rating of 10,000 pounds, it simply means you can tow the much weight without voiding warranties, and should be able to tow said weight reliably and stop within a reasonable distance.

Now lets talk about why hooking two trucks together doesn't show anything meaningful in regards to power or tow rating. If you hook two vehicles together, there are many variables at play. The biggest of which is the traction of the tires.  The traction of the vehicle will largely be determined by how much it weighs, what kind of tires it has, what kind of surface those tires are on, and how many of those tires are being powered. In this scenario, if a vehicle is heavier, has better tires, and more of them are being powered, it is likely that it will succeed in pulling the other vehicle backwards. This does not mean it is more powerful. It does not mean it is better. It simply shows that said vehicle has superior traction.

In the Cybertruck vs F150 ""tow-off"", we can see these variables at play. While we do not have exact figures on how much the Cybertruck weighs, most educated guesses place it around 1000-2000 pounds heavier than the F150 it faced off with. We also know that the Cybertruck is powering all four wheels, whereas the Ford was powering two. Finally, we can also observe that the tires on both were different. Unsurprisingly, in this scenario the Cybertruck was successful in pulling the F150 backwards. Claiming this test shows the superiority of the Cybertruck is not only dishonest, but also inaccurate in general. What it shows is that the Cybertruck has better traction, which by itself is a good thing, but does very little to showcase the vehicle as a whole.

How could this test be done better? Well, we would have to equalize a few things, first of which are the tires. Both vehicles would need to put on identical tires with matching, width, compound, tread, and internal air pressure. Then weight much be dealt with. This is not as simple as adding weight to the F150, as to be truly fair we must distribute that weight in such a fashion that the weight under each individual tire is identical to that of the Cybertruck. Lastly, we must power all four wheels of the F150. This can be done simply by starting with an F150 with four wheel drive capability, then using said function. In this scenario, both vehicles stand on more equal footing. However, all this would prove is that we can take two different vehicles, and make traction between the two similar. It does nothing to showcase the merits of either vehicle as a whole.

What test could be done to showcase the true towing potential of both trucks? Simply put, all we must do is hook both trucks to trailers loaded to their corresponding weight capacity, and test their abilities to tow their advertised capacity. Test should include in town/traffic driving, as well as on highway. Test should also include steep inclines as well as stopping zones, because as mentioned earlier, tow rating is not just the ability to move the target weight, but also the ability to stop it. What does this test prove? Nothing, aside from showing both vehicles can do what they're supposed to be able to do. We could begin exceeding each vehicles tow rating until one breaks, but such a test is ill advised, unsafe, and once again does little to show each vehicles potential.

My opinions on this are fairly straight forward. This entire fiasco is dumb. While I see the potential and market for the Cybertruck, it is not suited to try and replace conventional trucks for a multitude of reasons.

1. Price per performance. You can purchase a brand new 2019 F150 for a significantly smaller amount of money, and depending on which package you select you can get over 13,000 lbs of tow capacity. More tow, less buck.
2. Reliability and reputation. The Cybertruck is new, and entirely untested. Many truck owners need reliable, well proven trucks that can get the job done reliably. The F150 is a top seller for good reason. I live in some rough country where vehicles are pushed to their extreme limits and expected to work. Will the Cybertruck be able to put in work all day in 100+ summer weather as the state around is perpetually on fire and you are too? I don't know, but an F150 will. Will the Cybertruck be able to work in -60 weather, going up a 45 degree incline in three feet of snow with 6 tons on the trailer? I don't know, but I DO know an F150 will.
3. Serviceability. Doing hard work with your truck means that sooner or later, stuff breaks. If you break an F150, your drunk Uncle-Daddy Larry-Bob McRedneck stands a good shot of repairing it in the driveay within a reasonable amount of six-packs. I've never even seen a Tesla in my state, and we don't have a dealership here either. Something tells me I can't just ride my moose down to the local O'Reilly's and order parts for one either.
4. Downtime. Most of us cannot afford to have our vehicles down for any reason. I need my truck to work all day, every day. Run it out of gas? Put more in. In a state with between town distances greater than the Cybertrucks maximum unloaded range, I can't just plug the thing into a current bush on the side of the road and wait for eight hours praying a bear doesn't eat me for being a fool.

TL;DR In summary, the ""tow-off"" conducted by Tesla was not only dishonest and a gross misrepresentation of data, but also misguided and uninformative. Such displays are in poor form, regardless of who does them. While I wish the Cybertruck the best of luck in its endeavors and hope to see Tesla keep pushing innovation, the Cybertruck simply cannot replace conventional trucks in most situations. For some, maybe. But not for most of us. If Tesla wants it to succeed, their first steps should probably be changing Elon's Twitter password, reverting the body to that of the concept art, and marketing it as it's own vehicle instead of as a comparison to a truck that has already proven itself since 1948.",cars,1576004988,theonecarguy,38,0,True,2019-12-10

I considered a G35x, and with their going between $3-5000, a PPI felt reasonable there. However I'm now leaning towards getting an absolute beater Civic, something sub-$1500, and paying $150 or whatever for a PPI just feels like poor value at that point.

163,Vehicle sale and Title transfer issues.,"Location: DFW, Texas
I will try to keep this simple. I sold a car in June. My mistake was not signing the title over and having the guy sign and taking pictures of it. So he took off with the title and car. I began getting toll bills at which point I filed a Vehicle Transfer Request.
Whoever he sold the car too must have never received the title paperwork or lost it because the bank they bought it through reached out to us. Through those letters we were able to mail the new owner requesting she contact us so we could figure this out, no answer.


So I gathered up the letters and Vehicle Transfer Request and presented everything to the NTTA. They said they didnt care who was driving it, they only cared about who owned it and since it was never registered to another name I needed to pay everything up until the vehicle transfer request was filed.


Fast forward a few month later to last week. I get another bill in the mail, a recent one, I call NTTA and go over everything again. 

They said that I also need to pay this new one because the car now has new temp plates which are also in my name and because of the new plates in my name the vehicle transfer request is no longer relevant toward this new bill.

174,Just found out I've been 'engine braking' wrong the whole time,"UK driver here, just recently passed my test. For a few months now I've got extremely used to what I *thought* was engine braking pretty much every time I slowed down. For example, if I was going at 4 mph and needed to slow down for a junction, I would switch from 4th to 2nd and slowly come off of the clutch (without any rev matching) which made my car smoothly slow down to 20 without ever touching the brake pedal.

Today after reading a Reddit thread about this very topic I discovered I've actually been *clutch* braking the whole time, not engine braking like I thought, meaning I've been wearing out my clutch more than necessary.

Upon realising this I went for a drive and realised I'm literally doing this all of the time without thinking about it. It feels so weird *not* doing it. I'm trying to get into the habit of rev matching which is a little tricky without a rev counter (2006 Ford Ka) and also has very little effect.

What engine braking actually is just coming off of the gas pedal... something I thought everybody did anyway.

If I'm lucky enough to get my hands on an Escort GT, I have a half-baked plan for visual mods, like a bit of a Euro-market Cosworth look with the hatch spoiler, aftermarket rims, and the vented hood. The only problem that I have is that the taillights themselves are kinda small for that specific look, and the ridiculous reflector panels take up 90% of the space that was intended to be used. I just don't think it would look clean once everything was said and done.

269,Have we reached peak gas engine performance before transitioning into electric?,"So with more and more car manufacturers going all in on electric cars. Do you think sport cars have reached their full potential in extracting power from gas engines? Recently its all been about V4 &amp; V6 &amp; V8 turbos whereas v10/v12 have become less and less available. Focus has been mostly on aerodynamics to maximize speed and horsepower. A Century focused on maximizing gas engines, yet with the introduction of electric, even an SUV sized electric car can beat a porsche in a straight race. So is this more a reflection of Gas engines reaching their limit in terms of extraction of power? I know the main reason is that the torque in electric is instant, however, surely given more time we will have a mass produced, purely gas engine that goes off the line in sub 2s per 60 mph. I am asking this because as all R&amp;D focus shifts to electric, we might not see that development.

Some questions:

* How does a company like FCA have Jeep and Chrysler rated so low and Dodge rated so high when it's the same company and in some cases, the same assembly plants building these? 
* What caused Dodge to jump so high so fast? Was that gain entirely off the facts of the new Ram? 
* Genesis similarly had a huge jump. I get that Hyundai and Kia are ranked well currently, but Genesis last year was not. Was their lone Genesis branded car just not that good and it tanked their ranking until an updated version came out? 
* Mazda always came across to me as ""the little guys that just want to make good cars"" so I'm happy to see them ranked consistently high on these charts. 
* As a Gen X'er it blows my mind that Honda is so far down the list now. What happened?

291,The Love/Hate Relationship with my Jeep is now leaning more towards hate. Time to move on?,"Hey all. So about two months ago, I traded my 2014 Jeep Patriot for a 2002 Jeep Wrangler. I've always wanted a ""real"" Jeep since I was a kid, as I grew up in a Jeep family. Grandad worked on/drove them in WWII, and passed the love down to my Dad, and then to me. Long story short, the Patriot began to develop engine and AC issues around 35,000 miles. I was able to trade it for about $800 less than I paid for it due to the other dealer making a pricing mistake, which means I got it about $4,000 under KBB. Anyways, I put that money towards my current Jeep, the '02 Wrangler, and just wrote the dealer a check for the difference (Around $5,700 plus tax and dealer fee). Now, after living with it as my only daily car, I've realized it's just not for me and just doesn't fit in to my current lifestyle. My main issue with it is just the sheer lack of space. I didn't think it would be an issue as I'm usually driving by myself 99% of the time, but my new job has me moving IT/computer equipment, and sometimes people between local offices. Also, I'm 6.1"", and with the seat all the way back, my knee is about an inch from the dashboard. I think the problem is I've always wanted a Wrangler, but now that I have one, I tried to justify all its pitfalls and shortcomings by the famous ""It's a Jeep thing, you wouldn't understand."" But after dailying it for two months, I'm not sure how much longer I can put up with it. I'm considering selling it and buying a used/CPO 2015-16 Hyundai Genesis Sedan. I looked at one as a possible Patriot replacement during cross shopping with the Wrangler, and came away impressed. At this point, I just want something that's quiet, comfortable on the knees, can easily seat 4, and has a usable amount of trunk space. I've had my fun, but I think it's time I move on.

320,The Michelin Pilot Sport A/S 3+: an expensive disappointment,"Earlier this year [a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/av1t9h/looking_for_a_four_season_tire/) made me aware of the above tire, and so, I decided to try it out (much to my credit card's chagrin). First, the good things: dry and wet are fantastic. Feel above 100 mph is great, too. Inspires more confidence in those situations than the Continental DWS 06 it they replaced. Slush/icy snow/plowed snow performance is acceptable, but from the reviews I expected some loss relative to the DWS 06 in those conditions anyway. 

The problem is with fresh powder snow traction: traction doesn't just drop off a cliff, it goes into a black hole. There's nothing there. I've never had this issue with my DWS 06 or even previous Bridgestone Potenza or Goodyear all-seasons; all of those have done quite well in the Upper Midwest where I am.

At this point with the onset of winter I'm actually relieved I replaced only 2 of my DWS 06 units and not all 4. I'll be going back to whatever Continental has on deck (I'm assuming the DWS 06 will have a successor by then) when I get done with these. Sure, the dry and wet performance is supreme, but it's not worth the total lack of bite in snow and tears-inducing price.

My [opinion](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/av1t9h/looking_for_a_four_season_tire/ehc7n3w/) of Michelin (all-seasons) as snow ready stands: that they should come with free hospital visit coverage.

I'm *really* hoping this might be an anomaly and things will even themselves out; otherwise I might have to go back to all-DWS 06s and just swap the Michelins in for the summer since I still do want to get the complete value out of them.

Anyway if you have this tire in similar conditions too and have any tips for me, let me know. I think I might write to Michelin and express my disappointment.",cars,1576090507,jdrch,1,1,True,2019-12-11

Skip forward to this past few weeks, on the gearbox side of the engine I can smell I sort of burning smell, it's a wierd smell. Mostly happens after driving hard. There is no smell on the turbo side or to the rear etc. It smells like burning rubber sometimes but others it smells like burning and I can't think of anything similar to the smell, so burning will do.

The clutch only has 5k on it but the fly has 75k on it. I also have noticed a lot of vibration in the car, more than I remember in the past. And it seems to vibrate a lot at 60-70mph. Then the other day the steering wheel started vibrating aswell. I figured maybe driveshaft but it doesn't do it at all (not noticeably) when accelerating hard and there's no wierd noises during acceleration.
I did also notice a very quiet knocking noise when driving round a car park, the car was at about 1k rpm and literally no throttle in second gear, it definitely didn't sound like rod knock or anything like that.

Does this sound like DMF failure?

Some parameters we set are affordability, simplicity, and obtainable engines. Looking at you LS ;). The build is currently planned out to be Mid engined with AWD/RWD.

368,Worn down key or damaged ignition switch?,"Background: 2001 Toyota Solara, pretty old, 200,000 miles+

Has had a few owners, however, ignition switch is stock, never been replaced

Current key I got from previous owner is a copied key, not original

Okay, so recently, maybe in the past 2 weeks, my key would sometimes not turn in the ignition. I could take the key out and all that jazz but I would have to apply a little force and it would go through, car would turn on. This wasn't much of a problem, as it would usually be a 5 second issue.

Yesterday, it wouldn't turn at all. Eventually learned from someone that if I shake the key while trying to put it in, the tumbler on the lock OR the ""worn down"" (maybe) key would catch on eachother, and go through.

Little extra info, the key does appear to have a few dents, however, I say it looks 85% fine.

Now here's the make or break situation. Getting a new replacement key from the Toyota dealer costs $50, while getting my ignition switch replaced and installed would cost $450+.

Tomorrow I am going to the dealer to get my key replaced.

The question is: What's more likely? A damaged ignition switch from normal use over the past 20 years? Or a damaged key from everyday use.

To be fair, I just keep the key either on the counter or in my pocket all day so I'm not sure.",cars,1576112106,ThaRoastKing,5,1,True,2019-12-11

I've had 8 lessons so far. I go twice a week. We practiced driving in a parking lot, on the road, etc. We practied parking, left turns, right turns, etc. We haven't gone on the freeway yet, but we are tomorrow. To be honest with you, I am not ready to drive on the freeway.

I'm still adjusting to driving on the roads. I am still not quite comfortable yet.

He told me that most of his students need about 6-8 lessons to be test ready. I don't feel test ready yet. I feel like I am going to need a lot more lessons than 6-8.

I would just like for us to take this slower and I don't want to move on to the next step until I am comfortable with the previous step. I just feel like we are doing too much too soon.

419,What are your opinions on Hyundai/Kia's (or any brand's) development this past decade?,"As we enter 2020, I primarily wanted to get some opinions on how Hyundai/Kia have improved this decade.

Hyundai/Kia have been seen as the scum of the automotive world (at least in America) since their inception back in the 70's and 80's. They goal was to make affordable cars but they were known for building cheap trash cars that were unreliable, engaging to drive, etc. They've been trying to shake off this stigma for a while now and have been coming in full force in the past decade with their automotive lineup (Hyundai Genesis, Genesis (brand), Kia Stinger, Telluride, Palisade, K900, etc.) that have proven to be serious competitors to big brand names like Toyota and Honda.  

I've taken notice of this and decided to shift from Toyota to Hyundai for a little bit to see if they're living up to their new developing image. 8 months/24K miles in on a 2013 Azera and so far its been weird but good. Based on research done before and after making the switch and have concluded the following:

Their 2.4L and 2.0T engines in 2011-2019 cars have a serious defect (Camshaft?)

Their dealer network and customer service are among the worst in the industry (Hit or miss)

They have terrible resale value compared to competitors (From their prior reputation)

Their vehicles are actually very competitive in most segments they compete in (What you get for the price)

The Azera needs to come back (Grandeur?)

They CAN get to 200K miles relatively trouble free now (Hit or miss)

GDI technology has downsides that have made Hyundai/Kia start going DPI (Dual Port Injection)

They need to improve their dealer network for Genesis and the K900/Cadenza (Buyer discrimination)

1. Is it normal for vibrations from the engine (or CVT?) to travel through the gas pedal during rapid acceleration? Just curious if this is a trait of the car...


2. When I left work today, as I was backing out of my parking spot I heard a **creaking/squeaking noise coming from the front of the car**. It wasn't raining either, although it did snow in the morning and warmed up a little bit by the afternoon. As I was then driving around town, I noticed the creak noise a few more times, mainly when going slightly uphill from a stop sign or something like that. I then parked my car on the street and I was adjusting and turning the wheels, I heard a creak noise from the wheels too. Is this just a normal process of the car breaking in or something or an indication of the suspension getting messed up??? The car only has 200 miles on it.

It rained the past couple of weeks here, and I noticed it started smelling like mold inside the car. After further inspection, I saw that there is a leak inside the car, coming from the convertible roof.

Took it to the dealer to be covered under warranty. The dealer diagnosed the issue and determined that someone has been in the rear quarter panel area, and ripped the water drain part of the convertible, which is causing the leak, so they cannot repair it under warranty. They're not sure if the car has been in an accident or for what reason the area was opened, but they saw loose bolts there and the pain scratched, so they put it back together.

What do you suggest I do next? I am assuming the used car dealer will say it's now out of his buyer protection warranty, and/or deny knowing anything about the work done in the area.

10,"400 paint chips, is this the norm for a 10 year old car?","Hey guys,

I have a 2018 Mazda 3. So far I have about 25 chips in 7 months of ownership (lots of rush hours hwy driving). Of course I don't want the paint to rust so I apply touch up paint with toothpicks.

The touch ups don't look bad in the sense that it doesn't look like a blob, but if you walk up closer to the car, you can see where the touch up happened because it's raised up.

At this rate I will have 40 chips a year and 400 chips in 10 years ownership which I plan to do.

This is crazy... All the chips that I get are spread on the hood, both front fenders and both front doors, not even counting the front bumper. Some of the chips are literally toothpick sized, which are very small but I still touch them up in fear of rust. 

That will be 80 chips in each panel I mentioned in 10 years, I have never seen a car with 80 touch ups on the hood or a front door, I think that will look ridiculous...

There is really no way for me to prevent the chips other than doing a PPF which will be pointless and not economical at this point.

I don't tailgate and I don't drive next to other cars if the left lane is empty. I always try to overtake quickly, but sometimes I have no choice but to sit next to or diagonal to the car in the slow lane because of lots of left lane hoggers in my city, coupled with the fact that there are a lot of 18 wheelers in the slow lanes, many of which are dump trucks...

This is me driving carefully and avoiding paint chips, and I still get so many chips. I don't understand.

I live in Vancouver and I drive on Hwy 91.

Any of you gets the same amount of chips as me? I know it's part of the game, but I can't imagine having 80 chips on the hood, 80 chips in each front fender and 80 chips on each front door in 10 years.",cars,1573346845,jackspadewallet,42,1,True,2019-11-09

That wore off for me within the first few months of driving Manual. It seems some people are particularly impressed with themselves for pushing a pedal and moving a lever over and over again. 

Now before you question my worthiness as a car enthusiast you should know my personal car is a manual hot hatch; a car which I take to track days whenever I can.

Having been away from the hobby for the past 8-9 years, I’ve noticed many publications are now defunct and certain car communities I used to frequent having less activity than before. Overall, anecdotally it seems the scene has somewhat declined over the past decade.    

While the car scene will surely persist, I do wonder if it will fall into obscurity someday as the world continues to frown on the use of fossil fuels (rightfully so, I might add). Sure, EVs can be fun but I think many share the sentiment that the ICE is central to what makes the car fun, at least for me it is. Similarly, if autonomous vehicles are perfected and become the norm, I imagine society will look down on those that choose to manually drive their vehicles for deliberately increasing their chances for an accident.

Anyway, I think change will come slowly and can probably enjoy the way things are for some quite some time although it is interesting to think about.",cars,1573409937,throwawayjumpshot23,1,1,True,2019-11-10

Seeing Countach live for the first time was, as much as I was skeptical, all that they hyped it up to be. It really looks out of time, and sort of give me the blues about the over-tech world we have today, none of the cars today make me thing about ""this is how the future will look""...where as Countach really looks like some kind of concept futuristic car, even today, albeit a bit less of course, the wedge does show its age a bit and all.

But I have to say, as this was my first encounter with Miura as well, there's something inexplicably beautiful about that car. I know it's considered the ""original"" sports car with the MR layout and everything, but the lines of that car and just so perfect, not too much, just enough, accents on the right places, I was really impressed by its presence as I was riding next to the convoy while they were going home. A lot of people say S is nicer, probably because of the eyebrows, I liked the SV better but none the less, an incredible car. Perhaps the times of deductive design and taking off layers of clay without endless ""undo"" options put designers under more pressure to think and the results were more organic? I don't know. But it's an incredible car to look at, and especially see it rolling on the road...just perfect.",cars,1573418317,FullTopMax,6,1,True,2019-11-10

Rather than bitch and whine about the inevitable, can we take some time to appreciate the remaining options and how we will navigate?

My plan of attack is 2 pronged. The main thing I see in the market is that if you want 3 pedals and more than 4 cylinders, pickings are increasingly slim. So I hope to bag something used that fits those specs once the TLX is paid off. Corvette, Z4M, Rustang GT, whatever makes the most sense when I'm ready. 

My second prong is an acknowledgment of the fact that driving conditions on the street are increasingly worse. I'm somewhat fortunate in that I have a commute that's getting better with time (against traffic with lanes being added to my highway) but I don't know if that will last forever. So I've invested a good bit into sim racing, and once I get my nerve back I may start doing track days again.  To be fair though sim racing covers maybe 80% of my automotive itches. After some big write offs the general experience of car ownership is still a bit blunted for me.

Earlier this week, my alternator failed, causing my battery to die in traffic. Once I got the car home, I noticed a large amount of oil on the front of the engine and the alternator was saturated in oil/sludge. I suspected that the valve cover gasket or a gasket around the coil packs was the culprit and planned to repair it over the weekend. I bought a new alternator, serpentine belt, and gasket kit. However, once I removed the valve cover and cleaned it up a bit, I noticed this hole. https://imgur.com/gallery/4dXPS7m

182,What are some common performance related mods you feel like are wasted by the majority of people who do them?,"For me it's coil over kits. Recently I had a customer come in who installed the front coil overs but couldn't do the rears. I ended up doing the rears for them but had to spend extra time setting the ride height as he didn't match/measure or anything for the front. 

 But here's the thing. All he wanted to do was lower his car and get stiffer springs. The issue with coil overs is that not only do you have to set the ride height correctly, but you also have to set spring tension and properly corner balance the car. His coil overs have to be unbolted to set the ride height without adjusting spring tension. But on the front he had set the spring tension to adjust the height instead. By tightening the spring tension he increased the ride height on the right front, but also made that spring significantly stiffer. On a short road test it was extremely noticeable.

He would have been better off ordering a set of variable rate lowering springs and a set of aftermarket struts from Koni or Eibach. 


 That got me thinking, how many people are installing coil overs in their driveway know what they are doing? What other seemingly basic mods are people's screwing up to the point that it's just wasted money?",cars,1573445469,Slimy_Shart_Socket,120,1,True,2019-11-10

As much as some car enthusiasts may grouse about crossover SUVs, here I'm focusing on the more traditional type of SUV that's designed more for off-road usage than a crossover.

Vehicles like the Land Rover Defender, Land Rover Discovery, Mercedes-Benz G-Class, Toyota Landcruiser, Volkswagen Touareg.

What do you think the future market for SUVs will be and which would be the collectibles of the future?

For me:

**Volkswagen Touareg V10**: Due to the novelty of a V10 engine in an SUV

**Land Rover Defender final editions, 2016**: Last of the old body-on-frame editions.

**Mercedes-Benz G-Class**: It's a long-runner, although avoiding the garishly modded ones will be the hard part.

**Toyota Land Cruiser 70 Series**: Boxy and a long-running classic, and the next one could be a hybrid to replace the current turbodiesels. This one always has a strong market, whatever the bodystyle.

231,"Sticking gears, is it the clutch? - 2001, Toyota Tacoma, 2.7L","This is an ongoing issue that has slowly been getting worse.  It started with 1st gear not disengaging. I'd be in first first gear, depress the clutch for a few seconds when stopped and then release the clutch (at stop sign for example) the engine would still be engaged and the engine would stall (or if I am very gentle I could start moving without using the gas pedal). I could get it unstuck by shifting into neutral, releasing the clutch and waiting a few seconds or worst case by turning off the truck and waiting a few seconds. As long as I shifted into neutral immediately and never had the clutch pedal pushed in for more than a second, the problem wouldn't occur.  

The problem has gotten gradually worse over the last year (and even worse in the last few weeks, perhaps due to cold). Now it is 50/50 that it will stick in reverse and 1st gear. No matter how short of a time the clutch pedal is depressed.  More rarely I now have some stickiness when shifting while driving. It seems like if I depress the clutch pedal ~1/3rd (as little as possible) when shifting, there is less chance of sticking, but if I depress the clutch pedal fully when shifting, the chance of sticking is much higher.

It's an older truck, but I am willing to replace the clutch.  But I don't want to spend the money if it's not the problem.  Could something else be the cause of the problem.",cars,1573482388,zykarii,13,1,True,2019-11-11

Engine now runs noticeably smoother when stepping on the gas. (The old plugs had the wrong gap at about 0.042""; new plugs now correctly gapped at 0.055"") Before, it'd seem that car could kinda lurch when getting into first gear or reverse...best way I can describe it is that it was difficult to modulate the speed of the engine at lower revs.

I also noticed that two of the plugs had some motor oil on them. Specifcally, one had black oil covering the the first three threads where the plug base seats onto the engine bock. The other plug had oil on the first thread and a good amount on the taper (where there would be a washer in other plug designs) and just about 2 millmeters above it. Please see attached pic.

272,Have you ever been looking for a sport sedan and just ended up with a pickup?,"Long post, skip to bottom for TLDR.

My Z06 is my only vehicle and is stored every Canadian winter. This is my third winter not having a vehicle to drive. 

I drive very little, I take the bus to work and my city is relatively small. I drive the Corvette 7/12 months of the year and average about 1000 kilometers a month if I'm lucky. Half of of those kilometers are from ~400km round trips to see family for holidays, birthdays etc. Its about a 10min walk to Costco and a 10min walk to grab beer from a local brewery so I've made due without a vehicle for the winters.

Going into this 3rd year I'm now starting to just be annoyed at the inconveniences and taking the train/rental car to see family for Christmas so I started considering its about time to start looking for a second car. 

The vehicle would primarily be used in the fall/winter months as I'd rather use the Z06 in the spring/summer unless I have need to transport more then a single person.

I immediately thought an AWD sport sedan would be great and started looking some up, theres so many to choose from, especially in the used market.

Over the last week however I've been considering the darkside. I started just browsing trucks because why not? They have 4x4 and you can get some cool fun trucks like a ZR2, Ram Rebel, even a Gladiator. The fact is that the idea of having a sport sedan is still one that I really like the idea of but realistically, in my situation anyway, it would be a winter driver that I would not be able to exploit due to crappy roads and when the time comes that I can (spring/summer) I'll be in the Z06 instead.

So instead I thought well what if I just get the most practical vehicle possible that will let me do anything and everything with no fun factor to balance out the Z06 which is the complete opposite. Now I'm starting to consider pickups even though I will almost certainly never tow anything and the bed might be used once every 2 years.

Anyone else ever thought about getting a sport sedan or a sports car, was set on it but in the process of looking somehow ended up seriously considering or getting a pickup instead?

I know this sub tends to lean towards sports cars, sport sedans/wagons, hot hatches etc and not a lot of pickup stuff but I'm curious who else has gone through this.

300,Fluid dripping from 2009 Ford Mustang (6 cyl),"Driving home today during a snowstorm, after pulling into my garage I went to shovel my sidewalk and saw the drips in the snow.  They're yellow, maybe slightly greenish.  [Here's a couple photos](https://imgur.com/a/uuMl8Zc), where the car scraped the snow by the street, and also by the garage, so it kept dripping.  There were also drips in the street approaching my driveway.  I have more photos if it would help, but they're kind of all the same as those two.

I scraped some plowed snow when entering my subdivision, as the plows had just gone by (the snow I scraped in my driveway was soft fresh snow).  I also did a couple things differently on the way home.  First, my vent selector for heating hasn't been working well.  It wouldn't always change where the air came out.  For example, after switching from defrosting to air coming out at my feet, it would still have air coming out the defrost vents.  I was changing between having the hot air defrosting the windshield, and having it come out the front vents.  Sometimes I heard a clunk when switching.  I'd been assuming it used a mechanical linkage, but maybe it's fluid.

Apologies if this is the wrong sub! I know little about diesel engines so I thought it best to ask you chaps a question I have.

My father bought a diesel Nissan Qashqai (about a year old, less than a thousand miles on the clock) last year from a local Nissan dealership. It's been fine until recently, when a check engine light came on. He took it back today, and they've told him that because it's diesel it needs to be run out on the motorway each week otherwise it messes up the filter and the engine. Essentially, unless he does more miles it will keep happening so he's paid more money out for a petrol Nissan Juke (lower spec model, same year, 1000 miles on the clock).

I haven't heard this before and I'm somewhat suspicious. He uses the car every day to get to work and do the menial stuff. He does a few miles a day and he does go on the motorway, but it's not a massive distance (just the next town over).

Is this a legitimate issue or is he been taken for a ride?

323,Is towing in overdrive still a no-no?,"I remember as a kid growing up, learning to drive,all that jazz, one thing drummed into me by parents, mechanics, old farmers, etc is that any gear over 1:1 being overdrive, is unsuitable for towing at all.

The logic being it loads up the gearbox way too much and causes premature failure.

So I've generally tried to stick with this, pull out owners manual, find overdrive, cool, that's 5th or 6th, tow a gear down from at at 1.05:1 or 1:1 whichever is closed to 1:1 without being in overdrive.

Now my new car is a 6 speed, and 4th is 1:1, 5th is 0.817:1 and 6th is 0.679:1

So by that logic towing in 4th is ideal, but with a final drive of 3.818:1 I'm hard pressed to do more than 75kmh without flogging the arse out if it.

I mentioned this to the dealer and they reckon they've ""never heard of not towing in overdrive"" before. They also said ""It's fine"" and ""Why do you care,it's under warranty"" but they *wouldn't put this in writing*

My concern here is that if what all the old farts growing up told me is true, would warranty even still be valid? Could they claim undue/excessive wear and tear?

Or has gearbox technology advanced to such a degree that they are strong enough to not care?

I mean,I still downshift onto a hill, don't let her labour and load up the gearbox, all that good stuff.

We have the technology and have for years to make 12, 13, 15, 18, 22 speed gearboxes, most SUV's already have a 2 speed transfer, so why don't we use those extra gears?

I have tightened my alternator, because my car does not use tensioner pulleys. But it will always squeal, either on start up or when there is a sudden change in RPMs. It never squeaks on a Highway when I’m running constantly in 5th gear, and there is no sudden change in RPM.

I have a set of 215/45R-18 X-ice xi3's mounted on wheels with less than 8,000mi on them from a previous car. Our elantra gt n line has 225/40R-18 summer tires.

353,Steering wheel exclamation warning sign comes on and off in my 2005 Mazda 3 SP23,"Hi, I bought a used 2005 Mazda 3 SP23 (4dr Sedan automatic) few days back. The car works perfectly fine. But, just 2 days back, after making a 3 point turn, I noticed a yellow solid steering wheel with exclamation mark appear on the dashboard. As this was my first car purchase I was unsure of what it was and kept driving. I reached my destination and turned off the car. After turning it back on, the sign disappeared. 

I checked this warning light and came to know it was power steering warning light. And after reading what it does, I felt, my steering was perfectly fine. It was not locked neither it was hard for me to maneuver my car using excess force as some claimed. So I ignored the warning, as it was gone.

But, last 2 days, every time, I return back home, and try to get into my garage, where I have to do a lot of twist and turns, the sign comes back on. And as previously noted, disappears when the car is restarted. 

While doing these turns in my garage, I did notice a slight resistance of some sort **(maybe its in my head, as the turns I have to make require full left or right turns constantly and thus giving a false sense of steering wheel having some form of resistance while turning in either direction or straightening the car?**)- but to the extent where I was trying really hard to maneuver the car. 

I checked the engine, to check the fluid level, and the previous owner who claimed the car was recently serviced (03/11/2019), it was completely filled above the max line but just below the cap line (i.e. from the point where we filled. It was almost full). Can this be the problem?

So, I am wondering, what might be causing this problem? 

Also, I wanted to point out, this car had a after market stereo/radio system installed (where the touch screen does not work. GPS and TV has blue screen). Some one told me, may be something has short circuited or due to this after market system, the car's monitor is picking up false power steering warning sign.

As for checking in for leaks, I noticed a drop or two of ""mobil"" like substance, and the other day, saw a drip of what I feel is water (which some suggested to not worry as it might have dripped from muffler's water hole).

388,"Toyota Vios vs Toyota Yaris: Practically the same car, different target market","In general, **Toyota Yaris** and **Toyota Vios** are virtually the same car, but they still have their own distinctive features. Thus, below comes the comparison in terms of specs for which is better. 

Being a hatchback, the **Yaris** has a shorter wheelbase than the **Vios**. So when it comes to cargo space, the **Yaris**’s storage area can fit a decent amount of cargo, especially with the foldable rear seats. The **Vios**’ trunk though is cavernous, able to load 478 liters of cargo. 

As regards interior, the **Yaris** and the **Vios** shares the same features from dashboard, steering wheel to seats. The two models could also offer spacious legroom and headroom. A key difference is that the **Yaris** owns suede-like seats and synthetic leather on some parts of the doors while the Vios still has faux leather covering the steering wheel and the dash. 

In terms of engine, the **Vios Prime** and the **Yaris S** are very similar, generating the same amount of power and torque as well as maximum fuel capacity. Even as to safety features, both two models have most things in common. Nonetheless, some outstanding characteristics such as lane departure warning system and automatic emergency braking make the **Yaris 2019** more competitive in its segment. 

In comparison, the **Toyota Yaris** is without a doubt a premium hatchback, fitter to the young professionals in the city.

443,"Chrysler Prodded Dealers to Absorb Glut of 40,000 Unordered Cars","Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV has been manufacturing more cars and trucks than its U.S. dealers are willing to accept, at one point creating a nationwide glut of about 40,000 unordered vehicles and stoking tension with some of its retailers.


Four dealers, two of whom spoke on the condition they not be named, said Fiat Chrysler has revived what’s known in industry circles as a “sales bank.” The practice is decades old and frowned upon by investors and analysts because it can obscure an automaker’s inventory figures. Dealers don’t like it because it can amp up the pressure companies place on them to stock vehicles they don’t want.



Chrysler implemented sales banks in the run-up to the two times it needed rescues from the U.S. government, in 1980 and 2009. While the company is nowhere near that sort of trouble -- it just reported record quarterly profit -- the surging supply of unassigned vehicles coincided with a period when the company was pursuing mergers. After efforts to combine with France’s Renault SA fell through, it announced a tie-up with Peugeot owner PSA Group last month.






Fiat Chrysler denies that it has restarted a sales bank. The company says it put a predictive analytics system in place early this year that aims to better align its supply chain and manufacturing plans with anticipated dealer orders.


“We’re producing pre-specificationed vehicles against predicted demand so the right vehicles are available when dealers need them,” said Niel Golightly, Fiat Chrysler’s global chief communications officer. The modeling has proven accurate, he said, as Fiat Chrysler has ended quarters with as few as 1,000 vehicles that it’s ordered and been unable to sell to dealers.
Lingering on Lots

At the close of the third quarter, the number of unordered cars was down to roughly 5,000 vehicles. While that amounts to a rounding error for a company that sells more than half a million vehicles a quarter in the U.S., the process still left some dealers angered by pressure tactics they say can lead to bad behavior.
Fiat Chrysler recently agreed to pay a $40 million penalty related to filing years of sales reports the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said were fraudulent. One way the company inflated figures, the SEC said in September, was by paying dealers to report fake sales.
System Savings

Mark Stewart speaks during a FCA event in Auburn Hills, Michigan, on July 16.
The predictive analytics strategy was put in place by North American Chief Operating Officer Mark Stewart, who joined in December from Amazon.com Inc. Implementing the system and increasing the required lead time for dealers to order cars saved the automaker about 400 million euros ($441 million) this year through the third quarter, according to Golightly. The company has reduced inventory by about 120,000 cars during that span, he said.
Auto sales have been slowing industrywide this year, and the Italian-American automaker started building up the bank of unassigned cars this summer. Some dealers were looking to pare back inventory after being burned by rising interest rates that increased the cost of holding cars, and what some say was a lack of incentive support from the company to boost sales of older models.
While Fiat Chrysler’s U.S. sales and market share were roughly flat last quarter, it struggled along with other automakers to move old model-year inventory off dealers’ lots. It took Fiat Chrysler dealers 101 days on average to sell each vehicle during the quarter, 24 more days than the industry average, according to market researcher Edmunds.
Chief Executive Officer Mike Manley told analysts last month the company earned record quarterly operating profit despite paring back shipments to reduce inventory. North America generated the lion’s share of income.
“Working with our dealer network to achieve and maintain discipline with stock levels continues to be one of our top priorities,” Manley said on the call, hours after a preliminary merger agreement with PSA was announced. “In North America, our dealer stock is now in line with demand.”
Long History
The sales bank concept dates back to at least the 1960s. After Chrysler secured federal loan guarantees in 1979, then-CEO Lee Iacocca swore off the practice as one the company would never resort to again. He summed it up in his top-selling autobiography as “nothing more than an excuse to keep the plants running when we didn’t have dealer orders for the cars.”
But in 2006, Chrysler started stocking unassigned vehicles in lots around the U.S. and again strong-armed dealers to take them on. The U.S. government backstopped the company’s 2009 bankruptcy and arranged for Chrysler to emerge with Italy’s Fiat as a partner.
David Kelleher, a Philadelphia-area Fiat Chrysler dealer, said that while the sales bank was a problem several months ago, he’s confident the company isn’t going to fall back into bad habits.
“They’re not making this a practice. It’s a one-off,” said Kelleher, who sits on the the automaker’s council. “That’s in my rear-view mirror, and I’m pleased with the way Chrysler handled it.”
Give-and-Take
Just last week, Fiat Chrysler sales representatives told certain dealers it would allocate them vehicles for both November and December all at once, and that it may restrict orders for certain models, two dealers said. They viewed this as a bid by the company to work through inventory by prodding dealers to order cars that remain in the sales bank.
Fiat Chrysler said the restrictions apply only to certain vehicle configurations where demand exceeds production capacity. The supply of unassigned vehicles will wax and wane in a predictable fashion going forward, Golightly said.
Robert Loehr, who owns a Fiat Chrysler dealership in metro Atlanta and sits on the company’s dealer advisory council, said the stock of unassigned cars has an upside -- it allowed him to restock some higher-end Laramie trim Ram trucks on short notice.
“They’ll ask you to take some stuff along the way that you may not necessarily want, but you may need others,” he said. “It’s a give-and-take relationship.”

447,[Discussion] What’s wrong with my Mercedes?,"Hello r/cars! To clarify if I write something weird, I’m not really your average car guy who knows much about engines, to be honest I know about 5% of what it is to know. So I probably won’t be using the correct words for some stuff ;)

Now, I’ll get right to my issue. Me and my mother owns a Mercedes C220d 2015 (W205 I believe). We bought a used one about 6 months ago before doing much research on the car itself so that we knew it had no prior issues, also it had gone around 110000km.

About 3 months after this the engine warning-lamp on the dashboard lit up. A mechanic checked it and found out that it was one of the 2 NOX-sensors (a part that’s supposed to perfect the amount of diesel going to the engine I think) that had failed. We didn’t think much about it so we got it fixed and went back to driving it as usual. 

2 months after this the warning lamp lit up again, checked it at the same mechanic and this time it was the diesel particulate filter that had “clogged”. The mechanic said we could try to “blow it out” or something or get a new one (Hella expensive) so we “blew it out”, it worked so again we went back to using the car as usual. 

2 weeks after that, engine lamp again, checked it and this time it was the second NOX-sensor. Fixed it, went back to driving it as usual.

Now about 2 weeks after, today when I was on the highway, the lamp lit up again. We haven’t checked it yet but it’s still weird to me how a well handled, modern Mercedes are having so many issues, and that every issue is based around the diesel “handling” parts. 

So, Reddit. Is this a pattern? A known problems with these kinds of Mercs? What could be the reason for it and how do we go about it?

463,Advice on car for company,"I have a small production company and will be commuting about 20 miles total each day in awful LA traffic. I sometimes need to move art dept props and gear so a pickup or SUV would be ideal. However, I won’t need to haul stuff more than once or twice a month so gas mileage and size are my big concerns. I can drive manual. 
My thought was to get a Toyota Tacoma or Nissan pickup. 
Because this is for my company, the vehicle will be paid for through my company. I don’t have credit (not bad credit, just no credit). My partner who is overseas is suggesting I lease a vehicle rather than buying a used vehicle for under 15K. I thought that getting a lease with my lack of credit wouldn’t be economical but I thought this sub could give me some ideas. My partner would also prefer to go through a dealer if I get a used vehicle so that we could get a warranty. I have no desire to get something flashy or a status symbol though I do like being a little higher up for visabilty so I was thinking one of the slightly raised or higher profile small pickups. I don’t need an extend cab. Does anyone have any ideas here?
Also, if I’m being brutally honest, I’m not the most attentive vehicle owner so I’d like something that could get a little dirty or dinged up without issue—which concerns me if I get a lease. I will not use the vehicle for long trips but it will be my solo company and personal use vehicle. No need for multiple passenger space as I’m single and have no kids.

478,Should I Trade in my Fiesta ST,"I have owned my 16' Fiesta ST for 9 months now, I love the car! It almost always puts a smile on my face and it is 100% always fun to drive. Lately there has been some things that have started to bother me, my evap purge system has started acting up (off and on check engine lights), my blend door actuator broke on me (400$ repair for working AC) and now theres a loud clicking noise behind the dash whenever I change the temperature of the AC or heat in my car. I dont have a model with the lovely recaro seats and it isnt very comfortable for longer drives. Recently I have been researching the Hyundai Elantra Sport (6 speed manual ofc). Surprisingly it's a great competitor, similar mpg, similar speed, and similar handling. I could potentially trade my Fiesta ST in for a 2017 Elantra Sport with the same mileage (22k) for 2k$ less than my fiesta. The car has more space, nicer interior, a backup camera, and a 10 year/100k mile powertrain warranty as opposed to my 60k powertrain warranty with my FiST.

485,Nissan Lease,"Hi All,

My name is Kishan and I did leased the Nissan Sentra 2016 SV from Cochran Nissan of South Hills in Pittsburgh PA.I paid 36 payments on time and also they charged me for post lease Inspection. They gave me the price of $10667 to buy-off the lease and that was my best option because I was allowed to drive only 36000 miles over 36 months instead I drove 68000 Miles. Dealer suppose to report the vehicle as grounded to Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp (NMAC) who are the owner of the vehicle but dealer did not report the vehicle as grounded that is why I have credit delinquency on my credit report. I called NMAC about this and they said Dealer can still backdate the grounding date that way my credit delinquency can be removed.

The only major concern I had was as per contract there is 0.15 cents/mile charge per mile I drove over 36000. So if I have to pay for extra miles that would be 68000-36000=32000\*0.15=$4800. I went back to dealer to ask that and he never gave me clear answer of what will be the next steps. The only thing they told me was they will charge me $699 for making the car certified and then they will try to win the car at the auction and then sell it to me. I have got an email that they could not won the car at the auction. So basically I am screwed up now.

I just want to know what everybody else will handle this situation. I called Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp and tell all these and they said they cannot do anything until they see the sale statement and my end of lease liability statement. so basically I am in $5K plus debt as far as I can think of. Please help me how to handle this situation any input is highly appreciated. Thankyou all in advance.",cars,1573589630,kkpstarr,1,1,True,2019-11-12

Trying not to go into specifics (this isn't a question about buying/selling, it's about help with a fix), but this guy is selling a 2005 4Runner Sport with the V6 and 190k miles. Only problem is, he's selling for a lower price because there is an ABS issue that he doesn't have the time or money to fix, as he's been looking to upgrade to a newer one. He's not mechanically inclined, and I AM to an extent (I maintain my 05 Mustang GT which is a money pit :) ).  
  
He bought it last year and ran perfectly until he accidentally left lights on and drained battery last week. Tried jumping it to no avail, he changed battery and suddenly he's having the issue. Every ABS-related dash light comes on (ABS, VSC OFF, VSC TRAC), and a constant BEEEEEEP comes out of the dash when the car is started. He's checked the cables on the ECU/ABS module, they were in there good, and he ran through half a dozen of the $7 fuses to replace the ABS fuse, and every single time, they popped. He took it to his local mechanic, and he paid $60 for them to run the scanner and single it down to being related to the ABS module itself. (Note: he had brake work done a month ago, so brake pads/rotors are nearly new)  
  
Did some research, and so far, I found that the ABS module is attached to a unit that contains the brake booster, pump, and pump motor. Apparently if moisture makes its way past the motor seal, it can corrode and eventually reverse the polarity of the brushes in the motor, thus negating the functionality of the pump. When he jump started the car, it also likely could have done something nasty to the ABS module AND/OR the ECM (I'm no electrical engineer, but it's known that solid-state electronics aren't invulnerable to high voltage spikes induced by jump-starts).  
  
[Pic of the car](https://i.imgur.com/8Kn6BaE.jpg)  
[Pic of the ABS module in question](https://i.imgur.com/WVXamHT.jpg)  
  
To me, my next step if I were to purchase the car would be to purchase a used pump/motor/ABS module unit ($450ish on eBay) and directly replace the old unit in the car (would probably require bleeding the brakes).  
  
**Any suggestions/recommendations?** I'm all ears, and I don't want to jump into somebody else's several-thousand-dollar problem.

42,"Small rant about ""Rice"" and how it affects the car scene.","**I'm a big believer of ""its your car, your money, its your choice.""** 

But at some point, I think some people making their car ""rice"", whether it be a Japanese, German or American car. It damages the car scene as a whole; us as a collective group. People who might not know about cars will end thinking all car modifications are rice and tears our imagine as a community. 

As someone who has modified, built motors, and specifically used for the track and when I was younger - I did ""stance"" too. So I fully understand the appeal of ""show cars"", ""stance"" cars and ""VIP Style"" cars. They are appealing to look at and striking to see. But this is where I get into the ""at some point"" or ""the fine line"", I think when these ""show cars"" or ""Stance"" car guys start throwing in ""performance"" mods they don't need. It makes their ""show cars"" into ""rice cars"". I mean - off the top of head - I have seen people in real life and YouTube, start putting bucket seats, quick release steering wheels, roll cage, and all these racing parts into their stock motor car that has wheels that are rubbing or tucked. Why would you need any of those parts if you aren't racing? Or straight piping a stock car. Or getting 2-step and shooting flames on a stock sub 150hp car. Argh. I'm just frustrated with some people in our community sometimes... 

Another pet peeve of mine is: when the stance guys starts doing it to performance vehicles. I have seen people drive a BMW M4 with tucked wheels. Like why? Why would you purposely ruin a beautifully handling car by tucking the wheels? I have seen rare R34 and R33 dropped to floor on bags... Why?

66,Car dealer put 0W-20 oil in my car but owners manual recommends 5W-30?,"So last month I had my car, a Suzuki Swift, serviced for the first time at 15,000 km at the dealer's own workshop.

They changed various filters and obviously the oil. However I noticed on the receipt that the oil used was a 0W-20.

My car's owners manual lists the following options for my engine (1.0l Turbo K10C):

\- 10W40, 10W-30, 5W-30

\- ACEA A1/B1, A3/B3, A3/B4, A5/B5

\- API SL, SM, SN

\- ILSAC GF-3, GF-4, GF-5

They recommend using 5W-30.

Why did the dealer use a different oil? Did they make a mistake? Is my engine at risk?

I noticed that 0W-20 oil is in spec for a different engine (1.2l Aspirate K12C).

Temps here go from around 0C in the winter to +40C in the summer so I fear that the 0W-20 oil might not protect the engine correctly (besides the fact that it is not within spec).",cars,1570800228,thedarkdocmm,11,5,True,2019-10-11

72,"I'm Looking At a GMC C10, 1969","Hello, y'all.

This is somewhat of a story as well as a partial request for the wise and knowledgeable advice of smarter people than myself. 
Recently, I came upon an opportunity to buy a 1969 GMC C10 Stepside Longbed (I prefer the longbeds). I happened to see her with a for sale sign on the back, just as her owner was stepping out the door; let's call the owner Maria. I spoke to Maria and then later texted her to look at the truck in depth; she agreed on a day, a time, and gave me some information regarding the truck. Upon looking at the truck and speaking to the woman, I discovered a few things, the bad of those few things being: the turn indicator stick is broken, the steering wheel needs to be replaced, the valve cover gaskets are leaking, the driver's side door can only be opened from the outside, a few non-essential gauges don't work, and the clearcoat on the hood is peeling. The good: there's hardly any rust (I live in California), the paint on most of the truck is in relatively good condition, the wood bed isn't rotted, the automatic transmission was recently replaced, the upholstery is faded but not ripped, tires are new, and mostly everything else appears to work. There are some problems, yes, but easily fixable problems. Now I must tell you of the worst, at least to me: Maria is pretty much completely ignorant about mechanics and the truck itself. Because her dad solely restored it without her contribution, she can't tell me what's original, what's modified, etc. She told me the truck is a V6, but upon seeing the firing order, I realized that it is a V8. There are empty plastic reservoirs in the engine bay with their caps missing and she can't tell me what they're for.
So to put things plainly, her lack of knowledge concerning her own truck and her letting certain things go (valve gasket for example) scare me. In short, the issues with the truck don't concern me so much, but her complete lack of knowledge and information does.  A lack of knowledge and general apathy about one's vehicle can mean a lot of bad things.",cars,1570801625,AbExordiaMundi,1,1,True,2019-10-11

79,Why is the G37/Q50 typically frowned upon by r/cars and Jalopnik communities?,"I'm in the market for a 2nd car for our family in the $8-10k range (ideally something kind of fun....currently my wife and I  work from home and both share a crossover :/ ). There's obviously a ton of options, but I always seem to come back to the G37 sedan as an amazing value on the pre-owned market. There's many of them now in the range I mentioned with mileage under 100k. They've got 330hp and RWD, decent reliability (put tons of miles on the VQ in my old Z without issues), comfy interior and looks good enough (don't care about this honestly).  I guess I'm surprised that I see so many ""meh"" opinions of it. Granted I haven't driven one....however I've driven the G35 and Z which I've enjoyed. They both had their shortcomings (interior materials, gas mileage among other things), but were enjoyable to drive IMO.

What is it about the G37 that is boring? Suspension? Steering? Overall feel? Something else? And what are some alternatives that are more enjoyable?  I'm planning to test drive one but just curious as I keep coming back to 300+hp and RWD.

Does anyone over here have any experience with Noelle Performance (based in Atlanta, GA). This is the same tuning house owned by Karl Otto Noelle, Ex-Chief Engineer for Alpina. Apparently they moved to Atlanta, GA from Germany, and formed two connected entities, Noelle Motors and Noelle Performance, both based in Atlanta, GA.

I ask this because their tunes do not void the factory warranty and offer something like a 110-120 hp for stock B58 engines with stock internals. That’s a pretty wild proposition.

Just wanted to get some opinions from you folks out here who may have come across the name or had experience with Noelle.

115,"Drove my first electric car (Renault Zoe) recently, here are my impressions.","Electric cars are currently all the rage on this sub and other car oriented websites. Commenters here and car reviewers constantly praise them for their instant power and planted handling, so I wanted to try it out and develop my own opinion. My only prior ''experience'' with EVs was driving a hybrid Corolla and the recently added eSBR in BeamNG, so I called a Renault dealership and set a date for the test drive of a 90hp [Renault Zoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_Zoe). I won't really take a look at the car itself, but more at the drivetrain and how it behaved compared to my expectations.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, the instant response really is *instant.* Tap the gas and off ya go, no need to be in the powerband. This makes dense traffic trivial, I can definitely see why EVs are seen as ideal commuter cars. The top speed was disappointingly low at a mere 140 km/h, as I found out when I tried passing a semi on the highway. Short gearing probably explains that one, as off the line it's way faster than 90hp has any right to be. Power delivery felt like 130hp at low speeds and 60 on the highway, it was weird.

&amp;#x200B;

Didn't really like the lack of sound. There was a nearly silent electric whine under load that I quite liked, would be nice if it was louder. I'm not opposed to electric motors whining, but I despise silence. Give me something other than the radio/bluetooth/cd to listen to.

&amp;#x200B;

The regenerative braking was the only thing I explicitly hated. Maybe it was just implemented poorly, but it badly fucked with the braking feel. Hopefully you can turn it off in some menu I didn't have the time to explore. It was nice when coasting but replaced the brakes up to about 30% of pedal travel. The result was almost half a second of lag on braking. Fuck that, regen by itself is fine but keep it completely separate from the actual brakes, you'll save on pads either way. As for handling, I didn't really want to test my luck, so I can't say.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall it was interesting. Full electric cars have their merits, even some things that I like as a car enthusiast. But it's not enough to make me jump ship. I'll appreciate EVs for what they are, but I still firmly stand by internal combustion.

&amp;#x200B;

All my cars have been leases and I usually just always take it to the dealer when the light comes on. The EARLIEST I've ever seen the ""change oil soon/now"" was on my Grand Cherokee at 7500 miles. 

This morning on my way to school my 2019 Alfa Romeo Giulia displayed a ""Oil Change Required"" on the little display in my instrument cluster, and it keeps popping up every time the engine restarts (even during traffic when auto start/stop engages, so it gets annoying).

I've only had the car since May and it was brand new with 13 miles on it. The center infotainment screen still says I have 217 days or ~5300 more miles until my first service??

I really don't know what to do. 

There is no dipstick, but the ""electronic"" oil gauge shows it's still full. It has consumed a slight amount of oil since I first got it, but not a significant amount by any means. 

I know the first service for the Alfa Romeo's are free (1 year/10k mile interval), but this just seems way too soon for an oil change. But at the same time, I don't know. 

It just kind of freaked me out that the light says ""Oil Change Required""... not something like ""Change Oil Soon"" or something like that. Makes me think the car is telling me something could be wrong? Idk. Might be thinking too deep about it. 

Tried calling the service department at the dealer twice but no one answered. Since I don't know anyone who's really *good* with cars, thought I'd ask here.

157,Nissan GT-R R34,"Hey guys -

I don't know much about cars but living in Japan, I hear a lot about the Skyline GT-Rs. I'm just curious if you guys think the Skyline GT-R R34s are going to be worth anything when they are able to be imported back into the US. 

&amp;#x200B;

My buddy is selling his Skyline GT-R R34 V Spec and it has about 50k miles on it and is in great condition. He is letting it go for $80k. I've searched around the area and most seem to go for around $50k - $100k. He thinks it'll be worth a lot more than $80k once it reaches the 25 year mark and I am able to import it back into the US. 

  
I've never had a nice fast car before but would you all consider this a pretty fast car even though its such an old vehicle? Or can I get much better cars at that price point. It is appealing because if it does retain its value, I'd be able to drive a nice fast sports car for the next 5 years and then sell it for what I paid for it. Well after shipping it back to the states and whatever import fees i'd have to pay, maybe be out like a few thousand. Either way it'd be nice if it retains its value for the 5 years that I drive it.

178,Fair price for a rebuilt 2017 Honda Fit?,"TL;DR: rebuilt purple 2017 Honda Fit EX with 18,000 miles listed at $13k, KBB suggests ~$15k for an identical but clean title car. $13k seems really high, even assuming repairs were perfect, so what is it really worth?

Hello! I came across a purple 2017 Honda Fit EX with only 18,000 miles on it... With a rebuilt title. I know all of the standard rules for buying a rebuilt car (what to look for, get the service history, take it to my mechanic, etc), and I know that the resale value will be practically non-existent.

I have spoken with the dealer, and he says it was in a front-end collision but has been fixed to ""like new."" From the pictures, it definitely looks ""like new"" - everything is properly aligned, no scratches, and the paint is uniform. I worry about frame damage with front-end collisions nonetheless, so I'll be looking closely at that and the airbags when I check it out. But for now, I'm assuming everything is as advertised. 

My question is, what price should I go in at, if I decide to go for it? It's currently listed for $13,000, and in my area the KBB estimate for a clean title version is $14-16,000. The list price seems really high to me for a rebuilt title. But assuming the car really is in perfect condition, it seems like half of the suggested price is too much.

I bought this car 2 months ago. First car of my own, and I've never been responsible for maintenance before. I'll preface this by freely admitting I know nothing, Jon Snow.  
  
I'm looking at the manual and can't make sense of the maintenance guidelines. So I googled, and in some places it says take it in every 3 months, in others it says 6 months.  
  
It was a certified pre-owned from a Hyundai dealer and it's under warranty for several years.

1)  Do I need to go in at the 3 month or 6 month mark, and what do I ask for?  I literally don't know the right words to use.

231,Can anyone help me diagnose this noise on my Toyota?,"2007 Toyota RAV4 4WD Limited 4cyl. 140K miles. Video of the noise is here:

[https://imgur.com/a/WeL4NdB](https://imgur.com/a/WeL4NdB)

It turns out I bought one of the worst years of RAV4 when I bought this half a year ago (oil burning issues, anyone? Mine doesn't actually burn oil, surprisingly). Anyways, this is a noise I have not been able to diagnose, mainly because it doesn't happen all the time, but in specific conditions. I've spent hours researching and the only two leads I have are that it's possibly either the transmission (big F) or the real differential coupling. However, I'm trying to get one last opinion before I go spend the money on a dealer diagnosing it.

These are the specific conditions this noise happens in:

* The vehicle is accelerating (I.E. gas pedal is pressed)
* The road is sloped upwards (doesn't have to be steep either)

Obviously I'll be looking at exhaust systems, performance brakes, and maybe coilovers. I'm fairly new to working on cars, but I'd like to use this Elantra to try and dip my toes in the water.

235,Would it make sense to buy an older car with very low miles?,So I am in the midst of looking to get rid of my car ( it's an 08' Pt Cruiser and is barely pushing down the road) and trade in for something else. I recently went back to school and I am paying my tuition out of pocket so I do not want something extremely expensive. I am looking for something around the 12-13k price tag. There is a 2011 Hyundai Elantra GLS with only 16k miles on it at a local dealership and the car fax is indicating that is only had one owner so I assume it was a secondary car for a family and they just never drove it. The car is in pristine condition but it's almost 10 years old now. Would it be better to buy something around the 30-40k mark that is newer or would it be a safe bet to buy this? The only thing I am worried about is longevity and parts with a car almost 10 years old if I want to keep this thing at least 5-7 years. What do you think?

2001-2003 Buick Lesabre:   
PROS: Giant trunk, super reliable 3800 engine, good transmission, bench front seat is good for large people  
CONS: Window mechanisms break easily, not a ton of room for 'truck like' usage.  

1999-2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee  
PROS: Basically indestructable 4.0L engine. Great transmission. Proven drivetrain. Parts are super cheap.   
CONS: Horrible gas mileage.  Door hinges fail, rear gate handles are horrible. Tires are hard to find. (15""). Can be a rough ride.

1999-2004 GMC Jimmy (4 door)  
PROS: decent engine, comfortable interior, has a tailgate and fold down seats that make it able to carry a LOT of stuff  
CONS: engine, while well build, doesn't have the best fuel injection system. bad gas mileage. IFS is crappy to have aligned right. Tire wear seems to be an ongoing problem.  I may rule this out entirely just because of this issue.  

???  


Here's where I need your help. I need something that I can fit in. Neither my wife and I are tall, but we are a bit wide.  The patriot just murders us and the seatbelts sometimes feel too short.  I need something that I can repair myself (I rebuilt the jeep 4.0 engine in my driveway with hand tools), I need something that looks decent (I consider the toyota camry a giant Meh-Mobile even though its probably what I should buy). I would consider needing ball joints and tires not an issue.  Mileage isn't so much a question because we all know (collectively) what engines are good, and what ones are bad.  For example The 2.5L mitsubishi engine is bulletproof but burns oil reliably.  So the tradeoff is sort of 'ok' IMO.

I was leaving a car meet/show, a pretty
big one actually, in my 944. There was probably like 250 people waiting to watch the cars leaving, standing on the sidewalks and the median. I pulled onto the main road, right as the 944 died. I tried to coast past the crowd at least, but couldn't make it. It was pretty embarassing, but it is a pretty old car.


However, some of the people from the crowd graciously helped me push my car off the road and into a gas station parking lot.

In the parking lot, I popped the hood and started looking at the fuses and relays. After about 5 minutes, this guy walks by and asks if he can help. I didn't see how he could really help me, but turns out he was a Porsche technician! So he started poking around on the car, and not even 2 minutes later another guy walks over, saying ""oh have you looked at the DME relay? I've owned about 7 of these it's a common problem"".

So right there I had 2 of the best people for the job! They quickly diagnosed the problem as the fuel pump, since it wasn't making any noise when the ignition came on. Then they just hung out with me and cracked jokes until the tow truck arrived.

322,Got to finally drive a dream manufacturer for me... 2015 Porsche 911 Turbo S,"I'm equally both parts so happy I got to drive a Porsche, and yet sad at the same time that after this week is out, I'll most likely never get to drive one again (unless I get lucky/win the lottery).

Family friend was out of town for a week... My parents/I've known him since I was in my early teens but now that I'm in my 30s, he is in his twilight years and had a couple health scares, he has gotten more ""share the wealth"" in his mentality with his friends and family. So he asks if I can cat &amp; house sit for 8 days, I say sure why not. To be my utmost surprise, he says ""hey grachi, feel free to drive the 911, Rover, or the Bentley. Just try not to crash anything and fill up whatever you get down to less than half a tank on."" I laughed at first and said ""Oh yea, I'll try to"", to which in a way I never saw him look at me or in a tone say to me, ""seriously... just enjoy"".

I show up the next day and as 10 minutes later after he leaves, I open the door to his 2 part garage. The one houses the 911, the other two the Bentley and Land Rover. There it is: the 911 Turbo S. At first I just circled it, still not believing I was about to drive a Porsche, and not just any Porsche, a 911, a variant of car I've wanted to drive since I was 12 years old. I open the door and sit down and my heart just starts pumping as the on-screen speedometer lights up and that Turbo S illuminates on the further right panel.

I hit the garage door button, and then I turn the rather odd looking keyless ignition switch. She comes to life with a roar and immediately; goosebumps. I still can't believe this is happening. I back her out so carefully I was probably emulating an 85 year old woman in a grocery store parking lot.

I put her in drive and in Sport mode, and wind my way down his tree-lined forest driveway. Check both ways, pull out on the empty country road and let it rip. Immediately I'm thrown back in my seat and I feel a smile come across my face, and I start audibly laughing out loud. Then I realize tears are even starting to well up slightly. The immediacy and the response as I take her through corners, and then let the accelerator down in the straights... It is everything I wanted it to be. Even though it was only in the 50s outside, I had both windows cracked and the radio off just to hear every bit of the engine and that exhaust. After I get comfortable with her, I put it in Sport plus and watch as the dash informs me the chasis is lowering and the spoiler is raising. I take her through the best windy corners I know, same smile on my face the whole way. I drove the 15 minutes to my parents place and showed my dad, let him take it around the neighborhood, enjoying the same reactions I had just moments earlier. Quarter of a tank of gas later and I'm feeling greedy and somewhat guilty that I'm taking this car out for so long, so I take her home right before sundown.

The next couple days I take out the rover and Bentley as well. Honestly the Rover was just like pretty much any other SUV I've been in but had nicer seats and appointments in side. The Bentley is just royalty on wheels. Great ride but didn't have the ""passion"" I felt in the 911.

I believe it's a closed system when the car is off (correct me if I'm wrong)

It had a 1.4-liter/105hp 4-cylinder turbo *(*an engine that would probably be seen as ordinary by today's standards but exotic back then - the 2015 Fiat Punto 1.4 had an engine this size*)*

A few months ago, I saw a black one in the ASDA *(*WALMART to most American readers here*)* carpark, and it was in good condition for its age, despite being over 30 years old.

There's only *three* still in working order, according to howmanyleft.co.uk - pretty good that I saw even *one*.

The new Renault Megane RS 280 1.8 TCe is probably its modern-day spiritual successor - shame you can't get it with the sedan bodystyle, it'd look pretty awesome in black like the original Renault 9 Turbo did.

&amp;#x200B;

I've just got my first automatic (MY20 Jaguar XE) and whilst i think my acceleration is not as smooth as it could be it's my fault and know I have to e.g. be slower in letting off the parking brake, be more smooth on the accelerator becuase I don't have a clutch to balance it.

Whilst slowing the car to a stop though from e.g. 30mph I can't see how I can do this as smoothly as a manual car: If I take my foot off both pedals then because the engine downshifts as I slow it causes small jerks due to this and but much worse is that the engine braking becomes greater because it's putting me in lower gears than i would be if I was decelerating in a manual car. Plus obviously the lack of clutch control when you really need it.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone give any tips for how to slow an automatic car as smoothly as a manual car, or is it just not possible?",cars,1570998299,jamesp111,20,0,True,2019-10-13

Oldsmobile has been defunct since early 2000s. You won't see many if any on the road today. Similarly Plymouth went defunct in the 90s, however you may see a Prowler.

398,High-Pitched Squeaking Noise When Applying Brakes,"Hey everyone, I know nothing about car repair or how a car works, so I'm in need of some advice. In late August, I had to get the front brakes, back brakes, and entire hydraulic brake system changed on my Ford Focus. It was a standard repair due to normal usage and wear and tear on the car. Although the repairs were necessary, money has been a little tight for me lately so the cost was tough at the time (I think the price was reasonable, it just came at an inconvenient time). After getting these repairs done, I noticed a high-pitched squeak when braking. My mechanic explained that brake pads are made of very fine shaved-down metal, and sometimes the metal is not shaved down fine enough, resulting in a squeaking sound when applying the brakes. I took his word for it, and got the brakes changed at no charge. However, I still noticed the sound after getting them changed a second time. I have since gotten them changed two more times, with the last time being only the back brakes and receiving ""a higher quality brand"". So after 4 visits to a mechanic for the same problem, I feel like I've wasted my time and money for something that I'm not happy with. I know my car isn't fancy or top-of-the line by any means, and it's far from my dream car, but at the very least I'd like something that gets me from Point A to Point B without giving me a headache along the way.

At this point, the noise is so high-pitched many of my older relatives can't hear it. But everyone in a similar age range as me that I've driven with in my car has agreed that the noise does in fact exist, and is relatively loud. I have been getting complaints from passengers even without bringing the sound up myself. It occurs about 75% of the time when braking, especially when applying them slowly. The sound is similar to that of a large truck pulling up to a stop sign or red light.

Is my mechanic's explanation correct? If not, what are some other potential causes of the noise? If you were in my situation, what would you do? Personally I'd be willing to make visit #5, but I don't want to upset my mechanic as he is a family friend.

The CX5 is nice but just 179 inches and giving up the nice infotainment.

The Volvo XC60 is really nice and has a great panoramic camera, but is priced way higher.

We know that lots of electronics have been crawling into modern cars over the past few decades. While I think the inclusion of electronics and software into cars is good and has been a great help for performance, emissions, safety etc I don't think digital solutions should be implemented where mechanical solutions work just as well. This is a topic on which manufacturers and I seem to disagree on, however, with lots of new software-reliant solutions to problems that have previously been handled mechanically. Pretty much all of these electronics are proprietary and service on malfunctioning systems is impossible without expensive manufacturer-licensed equipment. As somebody who cares a great deal about product serviceability and lifetime, this concerns me a lot and I've been thinking that electronic issues might spell an early death for cars built today. In 2050 when a 2020 shitbox worth 3k refuses to operate normally because of some computer issue that can't be self-diagnosed, who's going to bother to keep it on the road? 

I think the 90's are the perfect time for cars technology-wise. Electronics helped to assist mechanical operation but (usually) didn't impede on serviceability or fundamental operation. Lots of 90s cars are on the road right now, and will be for decades more. Outside of collector-worthy cars, can we say the same about today's cars in 30 years?

458,Rented a car from Getaround and now I'm being charged $1000 for minor scratches on the rear bumper. Am I being scammed?,"A couple of weeks ago I had to rent a vehicle last minute. Getaround seemed to be the cheapest and most flexible option for me. I took the car to visit some family and do a little grocery shopping. I rented the cheapest vehicle they had available, which was a 2012 BMW X3. I picked up the car and went about my business for two days, returning it late at night. The next morning I get notified of a claim against me from the owner of the vehicle that the back seat and bumper were damaged. I found that odd since I never even used the back seat. [Here's the damage to the bumper](https://imgur.com/a/DpAducr), a couple of little scratches smaller than a quarter.

I have no idea how this happened. It could have been there before I rented it. It could have been someone tapping the bumper when I was parked. You do submit inspections before and after renting a vehicle in the app, but I've never thought to report minor scratches on bumpers before. So even if this were there before, I likely would not have noticed it, and certainly not thought to include it on my damage report.

Now the person has gone to a body shop and gotten an estimate for nearly $1000. There's no mention of the supposed damage to the rear seat. Looking at these photos, it appears to be scratches that are smaller than a quarter and I'm having a very hard time believing this would cost $1000 to fix. [Especially on a vehicle that's probably only worth around $9k total](https://www.kbb.com/bmw/x3/2012/xdrive28i-sport-utility-4d/?vehicleid=371228&amp;intent=trade-in-sell&amp;mileage=70000&amp;pricetype=trade-in&amp;condition=excellent&amp;options=4706891|false|4706892|true|4706899|false|4706904|false|6378958|false|6378959|false|6378960|false|6378961|false|6378962|false|6378963|false|6378964|true).

460,Why are manual transmission cars lacking a lot of luxury features that automatics receive?,"It would seem that almost most car manufacturers seem to put manual transmissions on their lower end models/trims and due to this they can lack some of the nicer luxury features that automatics have.

A lot of manual transmission cars can and do come with heated power seats and an auto dimming rearview mirror. What I'm finding hard to find on a manual transmission are things such as heated steering wheels, auto dimming sideview mirrors, and memory settings for the seat and/or side mirrors. 

Like don't get me wrong not all of these are essentials but they also don't seem hard to include as options on a car that could have a manual transmission. I can't be the only one who wants to be able to daily drive a manual transmission car but also have the nice features to make my car more comfortable to drive.",cars,1571027408,LosSalvatierras,38,11,True,2019-10-14

I know you are thinking this may sound ridiculous because it is 20 years old but both guys told me they wanted to gut it and throw a 350 in it. 

book values are around 1500-2500usd but i have only ever seen one that was same body style but an automatic and that guy wanted 5k.
